This morning, we woke to news Donald Trump has launched air strikes against a Syrian airbase. There is no simple answer to this crisis, and President Trump's actions risk exacerbating an already complex situation – particularly in the absence of any coherent strategy to build peace. If our ultimate goal is to protect people – and it should be – we must step up soft and hard diplomacy. We need to send a strong signal to Assad that his actions are intolerable whilst at the same time avoid any escalation of violence that puts more civilian lives at risk.
