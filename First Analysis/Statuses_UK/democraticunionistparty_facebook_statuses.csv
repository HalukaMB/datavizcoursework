There can be no question that the rights of British citizens to travel within the UK will not be affected by Brexit, and I am very glad that the PM has reiterated that this is indeed the case.

An Irish Sea border artificially splitting the UK was something which many remoaners were keen to flag up as an issue which would affect Northern Ireland. However today we have seen that First Minister Rt Hon Arlene Foster has been on the right side of the argument on our borders and that our voice has been heard.

From the very beginning we said that we did not expect to see a hard border with the Republic, still less, any sort of border within the UK. News that there will not be any de-facto borders should put any fear-mongering to bed.""

105732052794210_1270995022934568,"Musical Instruments for Bands funding to be reinstated
 
Minister for Communities, Paul Givan MLA, has told the Newsletter that the Musical Instruments for Bands funding will be reinstated. £200,000 of funding will be available for bands across Northern Ireland in 2016/17.
 
The programme, which is distributed through the Arts Council provides grants from £500 to £5,000 for the purchase of instruments to bands based in Northern Ireland which are formally constituted and who have not received a grant from the fund in the previous five years. It is generally accessed by the marching bands community.
 
The Minister said: ""It was very disappointing for many bands when this programme was suspended last year by the DCAL Minister Caral Ni Chuilin. Whilst the total amount of money available is relatively modest it is still a very important funding source for bands.    
 
The marching bands sector is the largest community arts sector in Northern Ireland with nearly 30,000 people regularly participating in over 600 bands. A huge effort is put in by volunteers who contribute not just musically and culturally but economically. The £200,000 funding provided within the scheme is part of over £1million spent each year on musical instruments alone.Bands also provide structure, discipline and a social outlet for thousands of young people across the Province and I will continue to work to ensure that adequate resources are available for the sector.
 
Bands from every corner of the Province have benefitted from the funding from inner city areas to more isolated rural communities. Our parading culture has been described as ""Northern Ireland's best kept secret"" and I want to help support and promote it. Over the next few days people across the Province will be able witness the quality of musical talent we have in Northern Ireland. We have pipe, silver, flute and accordion bands which are amongst the best in the world and the vast majority of these will be performing on our streets this week."" 

Since 2011, £200,000 has been allocated each year to the Arts Council for the Musical Instruments for Bands Scheme.",Photos from Democratic Unionist Party's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/democraticunionistparty/photos/a.106149206085828.8008.105732052794210/1270994262934644/?type=3,2016-07-09 10:54:15,55,11,5,55,0,0,0,0,0

DUP Leader Arlene Foster today met with families of those murdered in the Kingsmills massacre. This follows the reopening of a criminal investigation into the sectarian murder of the ten Protestant workmen in 1976.

 

Speaking afterwards Arlene Foster said, 'In common with so many of those who suffered at the hands of terrorism in Northern Ireland, the Kingmills families want truth and justice for their loved ones.

 

Whilst they reopening of the criminal investigation has raised questions in some minds about how this evidence has only come forward now, it does bring open the possibility that someone might finally be held responsible for this heinous crime. That hope of justice is something the Kingsmills families share with many others.

 

I would hope that the investigation can now move swiftly and the families would at least see some level of justice served.'

 

Local MLA William Irwin said, 'Having attended the service in Bessbrook in January, I am glad the First Minister was able to meet with the families again today. There are obviously many mixed emotions following the events of the last few days, but it is important that we stand in solidarity with those who suffered so greatly and who have waited so long for justice.

 

It is vital that the families are kept informed during this process so that their pain is not worsened through being kept in the dark about what is happening. Whilst we await further information about the inquest process I would hope that the criminal investigation can be seen to progress quickly.'",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/democraticunionistparty/photos/a.130975336936548.16016.105732052794210/1244732195560851/?type=3,2016-06-02 09:42:06,42,2,1,41,0,0,0,0,1
