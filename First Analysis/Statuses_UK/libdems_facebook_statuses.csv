Whilst we loved the experience of living in Spain, I have always felt very British as well as European. I was worried by the politics in Catalonia where most Catalans want independence from Spain and I feared things might eventually lead to civil unrest. I wanted the boys to have an English secondary education and for us all to be around my family. I hadn't realised how much I missed my homeland but have loved everything about being back, even the weather...  until Brexit. 

I joined the Lib Dems two days after the referendum and I am now the fundraising manager for Tunbridge Wells Lib Dems. Before now I have never been politically active in my life, other than voting in general elections. I will never vote Conservative or Labour again, who in my opinion have collectively destroyed everything I love about my country. I agree wholeheartedly with the Liberal Democrats' policies and hope that the surge towards fascism will be stopped by the Lib Dem fightback. My country and children's' futures depend on it in my heartfelt opinion.""

I see us as the only party that consistently stands for the values I want my children to cherish. Values like treating everyone with respect, regardless of who they are, what they look like or what language they speak. It's also the only party that strikes the right balance between what we do nationally and how we position ourselves internationally - we are all on this planet together. That's why after the referendum, I decided that I had to do more. I'm now the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for my London constituency, Dulwich and West Norwood.""

Since the vote to leave the EU, with the Lib Dems leading the charge against hard Brexit, it feels as though people are coming around to the idea that the Lib Dems may not be the 'half-in, half-out' party they once thought it was - we're standing vocally in opposition to the government on EU membership, climate, the economy, and asking the tough questions. Labour doesn't seem interested in acting for the 48% who voted remain. I hope people realise that.""
