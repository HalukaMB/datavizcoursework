I am rejoining the Conservative Party with tremendous pleasure — coming home to a One Nation party with a drive to deliver for all of Britain.

I'm impressed by Theresa May's ideas and leadership: already laying the foundations for a country that works for everyone; and setting out a proper industrial strategy. In her education speech last week, she showed she leads a party with a real commitment to delivering for the next generation.

I supported Britain's membership of the European Union. But the British people cast a decisive vote and all of us need to deliver on that verdict. I disagreed with the Liberal Democrat leadership — ignoring the vote and continuing with the status quo. So I'm delighted the Tory party is united in its resolve to forge a new role for the UK on the world stage.

Added to this, the Conservative Party in the Lords, with its new leader, is a broad but unified church that understands the purpose of our second chamber: to engage constructively, to scrutinise and revise. Peers should not block the clearly expressed will of the people or the Commons.

I will be fighting for Britain from the Tory benches from now.",,status,,2016-09-11 06:17:52,1068,116,74,1020,38,0,7,0,3
