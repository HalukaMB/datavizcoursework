Bernie McGuinness, wife of Sinn Féin leader Martin McGuinness, has asked the party to issue a statement on her and the family's behalf.

In this statement she thanks all of those who offered their condolences in recent days on the death of Martin and the many thousands who visited the house, held vigils or attended the funeral service on Thursday.

Bernie McGuinness said:

""On my own behalf and Martin's family I want to thank all of those who have offered their condolences since Martin's death, including the countless people who sent messages, mass cards and prayers.

""I want to thank the doctors and the nurses who looked after Martin during his illness.

""I also want to express our deep appreciation of the many thousands of people who attended vigils in the course of the week in many parts of Ireland and overseas.

""From Martin's return home on Tuesday, and until we left for the funeral service on Thursday, long queues of people visited our home. The family took great comfort from their presence. I want to thank the local businesses who during this time very kindly provided food and sandwiches for those visiting the house.

""I want to especially acknowledge the many thousands who attended the funeral. Words cannot express our appreciation at the outpouring of love and solidarity, which embraced us throughout Thursday.

""Finally, I want to thank all of Martin's comrades in Sinn Féin, especially here in Derry, the many stewards, the friends who travelled from overseas, and in particular all of those who attended or participated in the funeral service in Long Tower Church and at the Republican Plot, including the singers and the musicians.

""I and our entire family have been touched by the efforts of so many to provide solace and comfort to us throughout this very difficult period.

 ""Martin was my husband, a father and a grand-father. He was a republican activist for all of his adult life. He was passionate about his political beliefs but also about his many other interests. Despite the frequency with which his political activism took him away from our home and family, he was at heart a proud family man who took great delight in the accomplishments of our children and grandchildren. He loved his family. And we love him. Our hearts are broken.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/sinnfein/photos/a.149200528482920.34535.148726998530273/1237429139660048/?type=3,2017-03-26 07:19:56,2460,74,147,2004,217,0,0,238,1

Sinn Féin spokesperson for Social Protection John Brady TD and junior spokesperson Denise Mitchell TD have urged all TDs to support the Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age Bill being debated this evening. 

Speaking ahead of the Dáil debate, Teachta Brady said:

""One of the greatest challenges facing us as a country is sustaining the State Pension into the future. We know that pensions are continually referred to as a ticking time bomb. 

""This Bill is about giving workers a choice when it comes to their retirement. That is the issue that TDs are being asked to vote on. 

""And if this Bill is passed, it will do much more than simply abolish mandatory retirement. This Bill will end the scandal of 65 year olds being forced onto Jobseekers payments. It will allow those that have not reached the necessary 520 contributions for the State Pension an opportunity to continue at work and avoid a reduced pension payment. 

""Financially from a Government perspective, workers continuing to pay into the Exchequer rather than receiving payments from it will save money.""

Teachta Denise Mitchell concluded: 

""Minister Varadkar, as recently as last month, announced his intentions to make mandatory retirement ages illegal. This Bill provides him with the perfect opportunity to honour that commitment and do this. 

""The abolition of mandatory retirement has been a long standing policy of Fianna Fáil's and I urge them to support this Bill for the benefit of older workers.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/sinnfein/photos/a.149200528482920.34535.148726998530273/1209130299156599/?type=3,2017-02-23 05:17:26,103,17,30,98,5,0,0,0,0

You can view the Bill here www.sinnfein.ie/contents/43604

Sinn Féin Workers' Rights spokesperson David Cullinane will lead a Dáil debate this evening on his Right to Access Bill which seeks to ensure that Trade Unions have access to their members in the workplace.

Speaking today ahead of the debate Deputy Cullinane said;

""The right of trade union representatives to engage with its members in the workplace should not be feared but embraced. It is a right afforded to workers in many countries that are competitive and lead the way in terms of workers rights.

""Our Bill mirrors the Australian and New Zealand model. It is a model which works effectively and is supported by employers groups and trade unions in those countries. It is seen, rightly, as an opportunity to avoid conflict in the workplace and promotes harmonious relationships between a employee and their employer.

""Sinn Fein believes in strong, robust, fair and effective employment rights. We believe in the right of workers to organise, to join a trade union and to be represented by a trade union. We support the right of workers to collectively bargain and see this as inextricably linked to trade union recognition.

""The current voluntary system has worked for some but failed many. Some unscrupulous employers engage in campaigns of bullying, harassment and intimidation. They do so because they can.

""Decent employers should have no truck with such tactics. Those who value their employees have nothing to fear from strengthened labour laws. Those who seek to bully, routinely ignore Industrial Relations laws and ignore our industrial relations mechanisms do so to protect their interests over those of their employees.

""In my view a successful economy is one that values those who contribute to it. A successful employment rights infrastructure is one that operates on the basis of equality and a level playing field between worker and employer.

""A Republic is only a Republic in name if it does not vindicate the rights of citizens. And central to this has to be the rights of people in the workplace.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/sinnfein/photos/a.149200528482920.34535.148726998530273/1208346799234949/?type=3,2017-02-22 04:52:09,151,5,49,150,1,0,0,0,0
