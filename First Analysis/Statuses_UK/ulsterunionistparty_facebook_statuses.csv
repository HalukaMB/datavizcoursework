""I was very pleased that the Party Leader could unveil the portrait of Florence Breakie today.

107584191543_10154783599981544,"An Open Letter from Jenny Palmer MLA to the Members and Elected Representatives of the DUP

Friends,

I do mean that, friends. You will know that I hold some of you very close to my heart, despite everything that has gone on in the past. I know that there are people in the party who are good, honest people. I am making this appeal to you.

Ask yourself, and answer honestly, how many times have you been told that someone will vote for you in spite of your political party? How many times have you had an awkward conversation with a voter or constituent, who said 'I know you, I like you. I don't like the DUP'.

I know, because I used to get the same. I used to get people telling me that while they valued the contribution I made to public life, they were horrified by the behaviour of the upper echelons of the DUP.

Ask yourself another question; how many more scandals? You are a good person, and I know it, but as the famous quote says, 'all it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing'.

I know that many of you are uneasy sharing power with Sinn Fein, but that is part and parcel of how government must be done here in reality. But the scandals aren't.

You don't have to put up with what lurks in the dark core of the DUP. You don't have to pretend not to notice the Red Sky scandal, the SIF mismanagement or the RHI debacle. You don't have to be placated with the lukewarm (or even hostile!) responses from SPADs when you dare to question the leadership in private.

More importantly, you have a responsibility. If you stay silent, you give your implicit consent for the people responsible to get away this this. You alone at this moment have the power to say to those people 'no'. The voters will have their chance in a few years, if not sooner, but at this moment in time, almost no pressure from opposition or the media will have the same impact as you standing up and saying to the party 'no more'.

I know, because I did it. I know what power even a councillor can have by just publicly saying 'this is wrong'.

I understand your reluctance. I know how terrifying it is to go against the juggernaut of the party apparatus. That deep, sleep-preventing fear of 'what if I do it'. That fear that you'll lose friends, you'll lose income, you might even lose your career. I know, because I went through it.

I won't lie to you, it might happen. I lost friends. I lost income. It didn't end my career, because I have the backing of the voters and my new party, but there were no guarantees. But I had to do it, even if my crusade was a lonely one. It was the right thing to do then, and you know that it is the right thing to do now.

More importantly, if even a few of you speak up, the secret will be out. It will be revealed that the Emperor (or empress, as the case may be) has no clothes. The party has you wrapped in a fear that only you feel this way, that this only worries you. That is a lie, and if you speak to your colleagues, you'll find that to be true. Only you have the power to shine a light on the dark corners of the DUP.

And, goodness forbid, if you do find yourself punished for your honesty, you won't be alone. You might find you have friends in surprising places. I know that I did.

I want to close with a few words the late Dr Paisley shared with me when I was going through my own purgatory.

He said, 'keep the faith Jenny'.

If you know that what is happening is wrong, speak up. If they dare to try to attack you for speaking the truth, I believe that you will be rewarded as I have been.

With love,

Jenny.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ulsterunionistparty/photos/a.151103841543.115380.107584191543/10154783599981544/?type=3,2017-01-05 12:07:02,53,14,6,50,3,0,0,0,0

The day that was supposed to see the Northern Ireland Assembly start the long and difficult journey of restoring public confidence turned to farce as the Speaker Robin Newton MLA was unable to inform the House under which Standing Order today's special sitting was being held.

Mike Nesbitt MLA said:

""The Speaker wrote to MLAs on Friday saying he had received valid notice from the First Minister and deputy First Minister that they wished to make a statement on the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal.  But on Sunday deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, made clear Mrs foster would not be speaking with his authority, this invalided Standing Order 11. 

""When I challenged the Speaker repeatedly he was unable to name a Standing Order eventually pointing the House to Standing Order 18.  But this refers to ministerial statements and the whole point is that this is a personal and not ministerial statement by Mrs Foster.

""Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, the reputation of devolution has plummeted from the gutter to the sewer. 

""I urge the Speaker to reflect over Christmas as to whether he is the man to lead the Assembly in 2017.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ulsterunionistparty/photos/a.151103841543.115380.107584191543/10154727473076544/?type=3,2016-12-19 08:28:22,24,10,8,23,1,0,0,0,0

The law remains weighted towards the perpetrators of terrorism, be they Irish, Islamist inspired, or any other politically motivated group.

Support for innocent victims in legal cases is extremely difficult, hence this challenge is that ""the victims of terrorist atrocities might be legally aided, financially or otherwise, in bringing civil actions where the criminal justice system has not brought the perpetrators to book"".

Ulster Unionist Leader, Mike Nesbitt MLA, has secured an assurance from the Director of Public Prosecutions that he will not stand idly by in the face of unduly lenient sentences for animal cruelty cases. The Leader of the Opposition was speaking after meeting Barra McGrory QC and senior staff at the Public Prosecution Service.

Mike Nesbitt MLA said:

""I was heartened by the Prosecutor's obvious determination to use his newly bestowed powers to refer any sentence handed down for animal cruelty to the Supreme Court, should he believe the sentence is unduly lenient.

""His ability to make referrals only came into effect on the 1st of August and no case of an unduly lenient sentence has come forward in the last seven weeks. But animal lovers should take heart that the Director has alerted all his prosecutors and regional staff to monitor sentences in cases of animal cruelty and stands ready to intervene when appropriate.

""Barra McGrory has a track record of interventions in other areas where unduly lenient sentences have seen the guilty given probation, suspended sentences or concurrent rather than consequential sentences.

""My only concern is that there is no precedent for a successful challenge for an unduly lenient sentence for animal cruelty in this jurisdiction, and therefore no guarantee the first appeal will be successful. However, I am reassured that Barra McGrory and his team take animal cruelty very seriously and will not be found wanting if the courts need challenged.""

The Ulster Unionist Party is to form the first Official Opposition within the Northern Ireland Assembly.
 
Party Leader, Mike Nesbitt MLA, announced the decision to the Assembly as it sat for the first time since the 5th of May Elections, saying:
 
""We asked for a mandate to enter the talks on the next Programme for Government, promising that if either of our two tests were not met, we would form an Official Opposition.
 
""Those tests were whether it was a progressive Programme and secondly, whether we sensed a will from the DUP and Sinn Féin to lead collective delivery.
 
""On Tuesday, it became clear the Programme for Government will not be finalised until the end of the year, seven months away. On that basis, our primary test of whether it is a progressive Programme for Government, has failed.
 
""Our second test was whether we sensed a will to collectively deliver the Programme and that has also failed, as it is clear the DUP and Sinn Féin will retain joint ownership of the Programme for Government.
 
""Given the evidence that little is about to change, and we face another five years of DUP / Sinn Féin carve up and mutual veto, we are convinced the right thing to do for the country is to forego our entitlements in government and establish an Official Opposition, to both scrutinise the work of the next Executive and offer the electorate something different next time around.
 
""The decision to go into Opposition was taken unanimously by the Ulster Unionist Assembly Group earlier today.

Add his denial of membership of PIRA and Gerry Adams has no credibility. Even some within his own party must realise that now.

""To try to liken the fight against slavery to what was happening in Northern Ireland in the 1960s is contemptible. And then for him to claim that he was one of the founders of the civil rights movement. – even Martin McGuinness must be rolling his eyes at that one.

107584191543_10153952948261544,"Ulster Unionist Leader, Mike Nesbitt, has praised the Royal British Legion for today's ceremony commemorating local soldiers serving in the British Army who lost their lives in the 1916 Easter Rebellion.

29 of the 116 soldiers who died 100 years ago were from Irish Regiments, including 19 year old Alexander ""Sandy"" McClelland, who had volunteered to join his elder brother on the Western Front, but was sent to Dublin amid rumours of a rebellion, and died on the 27th April 1916.

His memory was honoured today when the local branch of the RBL paraded from Greyabbey Village Hall to Rifleman McClelland's grave at St Saviour's Parish Church, a few miles from his home in Balligan on the Ards Peninsula.

Mr Nesbitt said: 

""It was good to see the Royal British Legion take steps to ensure we remembered all who died in Dublin 100 years ago, not just the leaders of the Rebellion.

""Sandy McClelland was just 19 years old, far too young to die, as were so many of those who were killed in the Rebellion.

""No one needed to die that weekend, just as no one needed to die to get us to where we are today, a place where self-determination saw huge numbers vote for peace following the 1998 agreement.

""I look forward to leading an Ulster Unionist delegation to Dublin in ten days time, when we will offer a unionist perspective on the Rebellion, challenging the causes and consequences of what happened.

""The Rebellion was a seismic event, which reverberates today. It cannot be ignored. I am grateful to the organisers of today's commemoration who have ensured young lives, lost too early and without reason, are not forgotten.""",Photos from Ulster Unionist Party's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ulsterunionistparty/photos/a.151103841543.115380.107584191543/10153952944821544/?type=3,2016-03-27 16:36:06,129,4,26,129,0,0,0,0,0

107584191543_10153933501446544,"Ulster Unionists publish Cancer Care policy paper

The Ulster Unionist Party has today launched the fourth in a series of detailed policy papers. The latest document focuses on the growing concern for cancer care across Northern Ireland.

Some of the key proposals in the paper include:

Setting a target date of 2035 for Northern Ireland to be tobacco free with a recorded incidence of less than 5%;

Introducing a dignity charter across each of the Health and Social Care Trusts so that patients are at the centre of their care and decision making process;

Ensuring that every patient diagnosed with cancer has access to a Clinical Nurse Specialist;

Improving GP access to diagnostics by giving them the power to refer directly for key diagnostic tests;

Reducing the age for the bowel screening programme to those aged 55;

Ensuring children and young people with a cancer diagnosis are able to access quality alternative provision to continue their education.

Ulster Unionist Party Leader, Mike Nesbitt MLA, said:

""Very few people across Northern Ireland have managed to escape being touched by cancer, be it personally or through witnessing the impact it has on a family member or friend. It is an intensely cruel and unforgiving disease and it is the number one cause of death with sadly up to 4,000 people here succumbing to the ravages of the disease every year.

""Yet the reality is more than one in three people in Northern Ireland will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, and in only 5 years' time that rate will have risen to almost one in two.

""The scale of the disease, and the even greater prominence it is going to display over the years to come means that cancer prevention, early detection and timely treatment must remain a top priority within the health agenda for Northern Ireland. In this document you will see how the Ulster Unionist Party proposes to contribute to that process.""

Ulster Unionist Party Health Spokesperson, Jo-Anne Dobson MLA, said:

""A cancer diagnosis not only shocks the patient but also their entire circle of family and friends. In recent weeks I lost one of my closest friends to the disease and it has unfortunately become one of the most significant health concerns we as a society are facing.

""Whilst the number of people being diagnosed with cancer here is growing year-on-year, we should take some comfort that rapid advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer means that more of us are beating the disease than ever before. It certainly is no longer the death sentence it once was and with every passing year our local research institutions are making ground-breaking innovations. 

""It is essential however that for those who are not fortunate enough to beat the disease that they are treated with the care and dignity to give them both comfort and peace in their final months. That is why I am particularly pleased that we have suggested a number of sensible proposals to improve end of life care here in Northern Ireland.""

Sandra Overend MLA said:

The significance of the progress in the democratic system is not lost on me as I come to the end of my first term as a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, seeking to be elected for a second term. 

""Today also provides the opportunity to look at the work still to be done.  We must not forget that we live in a world where gender can still define the direction of travel of your life.  It can still prevent you from having access to an education.  There are women who are still subject to slavery, trafficking and female genital mutilation.  This must motivate us all to bring change. 

""While we should celebrate how far we have come in nations such as the United Kingdom, we must refocus on what still needs to done to progress gender parity both here and across the world.

""I think Lesley is the perfect choice for the people of North Belfast, an area that suffered like no other during the Troubles, and continues to endure the legacy in terms of poor mental health and wellbeing, insufficient social housing and limited opportunities in employment and education.
 
""The church's loss will be politics' gain. If endorsed by the people, she will bring fresh ideas, energy and an inquisitive mind to Stormont, and will challenge us all to stretch ourselves further to deliver a society that offers social justice for all.

Lesley Carroll said:
 
""I`m looking forward to the next couple of months. It`s a new challenge, but I`ll use all my past experience of working on the ground to get out and about and speak to as many people as possible before 5th May.
 
""I have a real passion for North Belfast and its people. I want to make a difference, and after conversations with Mike Nesbitt and much thought, that`s why I`ll be standing as an Ulster Unionist Party candidate in North Belfast in the forthcoming Assembly elections. I`ve lived and worked here for over thirty years. It`s my home and I care about all its people. There is so much good going on, but sometimes that story isn`t told.
 
""I have a vision for a community in which people collaborate to achieve the best possible North Belfast for all its communities. I have worked alongside people in some of the most difficult circumstances of their lives and from these experiences I`ve developed a compassionate understanding of people's needs. I am committed to social justice in education, community development, health and wellbeing, capacity building and addressing the needs of real people and their too often challenging circumstances.
 
""I will work with everyone to increase community safety, bring better housing, increase job opportunities and build an inclusive, welcoming community for all. I believe that we can create a more vibrant North Belfast in which successes are celebrated and built upon, but that will also require urban redevelopment.
 
""I want young people to be able turn their lives around, achieve their potential, and know that they are valued members of society and can become contributors to building the vibrant North Belfast which we all want. If North Belfast is to become as multi-cultural, lively, diverse and welcoming as we want it to be then provision needs to be made for the needs of everyone and for accessible services. All communities need to bring their hopes and concerns to the urban redevelopment agenda. I will work to give everyone a voice and to deliver the kind of urban redevelopment that will change the face of North Belfast making it a bright, engaging place to live, work, bring up children and invest in.

My thoughts are with the injured prison officer, his family, friends and colleagues and I hope that he will make a full recovery.

""This will only serve to re-traumatise victims of terrorism. There are families sitting at home this morning listening to the news who thought that we had left these days behind. We must think about the wider impact that this will have on others such as David Black`s family. The terrorists will not be allowed to drag Northern Ireland back to the dark days of the past. We must stand together, shoulder to shoulder and face them down. It is possible to stop this. The history of terrorism is that it only survives when there is a level of community support, be it the act of the turning of a blind eye. Even Gerry Adams acknowledged it - 'The IRA will only be defeated when the wee women (of West Belfast) throw the guns onto the street.'

Ulster Unionists Andy Allen MLA and Councillor Chris McGimpsey have commented following a bomb explosion in East Belfast. 

Andy Allen MLA said:
 
""This is not the news anyone wanted to wake up to this morning.  Firstly my thoughts are with the injured man and his family and I hope that he will make a recovery.  My thoughts are also with the local community who have been thrown into chaos this morning. 

""We will await updates from the PSNI but I am angry and frustrated that a prison officer has been the victim of an explosive device.  This is not the society we want to live in.""
 
Councillor Chris McGimpsey said: 

""I don't think I'm alone in having thought we had left those days behind.  This is a worrying development and I would pay tribute to the police and emergency services this morning.  

""I hope that the man will make a recovery following this incident and I'm sure the local community will be united in that hope.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ulsterunionistparty/photos/a.151103841543.115380.107584191543/10153871349936544/?type=3,2016-03-04 04:52:30,11,0,2,11,0,0,0,0,0
