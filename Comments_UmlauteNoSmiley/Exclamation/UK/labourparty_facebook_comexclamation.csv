The government says it wants to move from low wages, high benefits to the opposite, which is one of the most obvious policies to announce but important nevertheless. The government must support small to medium sized businesses when they increase the minimum wage in either tax cuts or employer national insurance contributions. Bigger companies such as Lidl and Aldi have led the way choosing salaries above minimum wage and closer to living wage. They get their staff to be more productive and pay them well.

"'Peter Walsh ""every worker deserves a living wage"" Why? A ""living wage"" is surely enough total income to meet a socially acceptable standard of living. That is not the same as a ph minimum wage rate. Try working one shift a week on ph. Is that a living wage? Besides, plenty of low paid workers are not in households which are in poverty. Often we\'re talking about young workers living with parents on reasonable salaries or the second income for a couple, or pensioners with an additional income stream. These people don\'t really depend on the low pay to survive so much as to provide extras.Low pay may be associated with poverty but does not automatically signify it. I can think of nothing I could legally do which would induce an employer to pay me the minimum wage rate Labour is proposing. I just don\'t see the value of my output as being that high. Why should an employer be forced to pay more than my worth when I\'m quite willing to be realistic and accept less? Would you have Labour make me unemployed of forced to work illegally cash in hand? This idea that businesses are failing because they can\'t afford to pay ph seems wrongheaded. A business is failing if it can\'t afford to keep going.

Or will the price war simply continue as it has done so far. That's my ignorant knowledge part. Now, I've gone away and researched inflation, and you're looking at cost-push inflation, the idea that companies will pass on the cost of rising wages. Yes that is a possibility, in my original comment I said that we must ensure that the government introduces this in a way that doesn't affect small to medium sized businesses and I gave the example of childcare places like nurseries. Childcare costs are very high and companies are struggling as there are long days (requiring two lots of staff to be hired, and legal limits to the number of staff per child). The increased wages will increase the spend in the local economy as someone else pointed out. But again, as I previously mentioned, it could tackle our woefully low productivity and we are around 30% less productive than French workers. Even a very modest increase in productivity would help the economy greatly. The reason why the government should soften the blow to SME's is that it should fit the reducing need for in work benefits which is a long term structural issue that would be worth funding for at least 3 years. Employer NI is possibly the easiest way to offer a rebate and allow them to keep their staff and hire more if they want to. The government subsises wages anyway.

So that they don't have to worry about paying the rent putting food on the table and paying other bills. The have more disposable income. Now guess what they do with that disposable income. They save some and they spend some. Guess where they spend it. Mostly in their local small businesses. So therefor the profits of those businesses go up. Which in turn means they can afford to pay their employees more while still turning a profit. That's basically how it works. Go look at places that pay a living wage now a real one. And you will see not only does it benefit the employees but it also benefits the economy over all. Now their are other things that need to go hand in hand with a living wage to ensure it works. First of close all the tax loopholes and Haven's and claw back the billions we are owed in unpaid taxes. Secondly tie that living wage to the rate of inflation with incremental changes depending on where you live. so that you are always able to live on that wage. Thirdly rent controls. To ensure that greedy landlords can rip off their tenants by jacking up rents. By creating a real living wage and following the above steps then everybody wins. But the only way any of that happens is by voting for j.c and labour. *************ADDENDUM***************** One more point I would like to add. We also need to RE work our system of taxation. To ensure that it is fair representative and proportionate. The current system is massively unfair with those least able to afford it shouldering the majority of the fiscal responsibility. While those who can afford to pay more try and do every trick and twist in the book to pay as little as they can get away with. And it appears to me as if those in society who are the most well of are the same ones who pay the least amount of tax.""",368,0,0.0

We allowed for the fact that Russia was helping him to fight ISIS but three things didn\'t weigh up. \r The time it is taking to defeat ISIS- Russia\'s war style would have taken them out immediately with some disregard to civilians. Russia could have routed their army as ISIS moves in convoys. Russia was using ISIS as a cover to slow down their removal for her own ends, though Russia also genuinly wants rid of them as much as we do. There is no room for terrorists with anybody.\r That Russia has bombed Western supported rebel groups in Syria, enemies of President Assad, more than she has fought ISIS, because she sapped their strength when she could see they were defeating ISIS too quickly for her own advent into Syria to be ultimately long-term. Russia has been biding for time to become long-established in Syria in the eyes of the world. Why would she want to leave a country she has defended so nobly? Russia has been slowly creeping in to Syria and we must tell Russia to leave now.\r That Russia hangs onto an elected leader when his majority electorate wouldn\'t have him after his deeds when he took office. Russia should have called new elections immediately in Syria. When civil war followed only a vote. Only a job as President another better man could be found to fill. Yet Russia allowed the Assad personality cult to dominate as one man.\r And maybe a fourth, for Russia refused to move over and out when President Trump asked them: ""Now I am in office, why not just let me finish ISIS off?"" And Russia, never having complained about the expense of war, refused with a moot excuse that there was an obligation to President Assad, and how Russia wanted rid of ISIS. Suspiciously only too glad to help. And she is planning to keep her version of a divided Syria by spending billions of roubles more for a permanent future there\r Russia is self-serving whilst she helps the enemies of the West we wanted rid of. We asked ourselves ""why is Russia bombing the rebel opposition the USA and the UK support, when they are fighting ISIS, everyone\'s first priority - or are they? For Russia is planning a long-term presence and is still in the initial stages of forming her military base at the port of Latakia. To do this and slowly creep into Syria permanently she has slowed down her operations against ISIS to an almost amateur guerilla war level. Russia could have wiped ISIS out single-handedly a long time ago. Biding her time in case she loses her ally, Assad, to far off elections when she will say she is established in Latakia and cannot leave after Syria finds peace. Russia wants a hostile, divided world and a strong presence in the Middle East. \r And why is President Assad also side-tracked from defeating ISIS, and bombing his political military Syrian opponents in the face of the USA, instead of asking for or promising elections after the known expected demise of ISIS, not very far off? Well, we know it is to stay in power as long as he can and Assad will be happy for a Russian presence in Syria to last a very long time as his strong friend. But he has been using war against ISIS as a cover for largely targetting those enemy rebel groups whilst telling Russia he had intelligence that ISIS was amongst them he had to annhiliate. Russia has no real interest in Assad except to bide time and fool the West that they are only there for the same reason as we are, to fight ISIS. Assad knows only Russia will have him and the West does not want hostilities there.\r Assad isn\'t the only Soviet puppet. Latakia port will be the prime puppet show when Russia will divide and rule, hoping the West will leave a government too afraid of Russia and under Assad preferably. A Punch and Judy show to continue to fool the West. We need to blow their cover now before Russia gets a firm foothold in Syria. The Syrian people deserve peace, freedom and democracy.

As it stands the state pays around pa to educate kids in the public system, whereas the kids in the private system don\'t receive this public spending. It seems a bit much to then ask that the parents of privately educated kids to pay for the dinners of kids who are already getting a much better deal from the state than their own kids are. I quite like the idea of universal benefits but this policy doesn\'t do that. There are no free lunches for secondary school kids, the packed lunchers, or the home educated, or the privately educated.

Any of us who have been in that situation know you really just want to pig out on 'something nice' . Fruit and salad does not do that for you. Some families have been living like that for years and have lost all motivation. The way to tackle that though in not to give every child of primary school age a free meal every day. We know that bikes are healthy for kids. They encourage exercise and fight obesity but we would never consider buying a bike for every child.What we should be doing is getting parents into work, building their skills and qualifications, and raising their income levels.

It would seem obvious that a malnourished child would achieve better at school if you feed him or her but thats not a reason to give free school meals to every other child of primary school age in the country.

The stigma associated with receiving free or reduced lunches can be eliminated by using a ticket system (either paper tickets or electronic systems parents pay into if needed) so that students can't tell who paid what. Even upgrading to an electronic system would be significantly cheaper than funding all the lunches. Also, it is unfair to fund this through taxes on private school fees. I can tell you for a fact that there are many parents sacrificing a great deal to send their child to private schools. They are already funding state schools through National Insurance and council tax contributions, so they should not essentially be triple taxed. It feels as if you are punishing those who choose not to use the state school route. And with how oversubscribed many state schools are, the worst thing would be to tax children out of the private sector and into the state.

The VED comparison doesn't fit. From my understanding, the government is expecting private schools to provide services to the community as part of their not for profit status. Opening up facilities for the community and state schools to use. Allowing state school pupils to attend undersubscribed specialist classes in secondary school or sending those specialist teachers into the state schools. Allowing state school students to participate in some of the extracurricular activities. Offering state school teachers the opportunity to attend training days, or offering training days at state schools. Offering bursaries to low income students in the community. Or even sponsoring a state school that is switching to academy status.

Of this, 32 per cent in Newham and 46 per cent in Durham was deadweight cost (that is, involved paying for meals that would otherwise have been paid for by parents). Other initiatives targeting similar outcomes, such as the Jamie Oliver \'Feed Me Better\' campaign, appeared to be able to deliver significant impacts at substantially lower cost."" If 46% of the money spent on the scheme in Durham (chosen because it was an area of high deprivation) was effectively spending, not on improving nutritional standards in schools, but increasing the disposable incomes of parents whose children already ate school meals, how much more will be wasted in areas of average or even high levels of affluence? Why should parents who are already saving the public purse the cost of a school place be expected to raise the incomes of ordinary parents up and down the country by charging VAT on top of what they pay already so they get to feed all primary school kids? One of the key features of the current system is that it enables teachers to identify children who receive free school meals who may also need help and due consideration in other areas of school life. Free school meals for all means this marker is lost to teachers who will be less able to bear individual circumstances in mind in their dealings with and approach to kids. The policy is nuts.

"""The BBC are a one-sided news reporting organization I have determined over the last 5-decades. They reported today the negative side of people who gathered for a 'stop the war' demonstration. a democratic right of the people to do such things when politicians can endanger the lives of their loved ones in any military confrontation. But other than say this, the BBC took the view that a Syrian refugee was 'opposed' by the group. This again shows that the BBC is not the true news, but a propaganda machine for a bad government that did not even investigate to obtain unequivocal evidence (not just photos showing the 'white helmets' pulling so-called victims out of the rubble straight after the attack that released the chemicals. Indeed the British and US governments only assume and where if Sarin had been used, why were not the 'white helmets' wearing complete medical and chemical warfare sealed suits or even gloves or masks, as Sarin according to the WHO only takes a pinhead droplet to kill a human and is over 20-times more deadly than cyanide. If the BBC reported these facts as well they would have a balanced view of the outside world, but they never do having observed their news reporting for over 50 years. The people need the truth and both sides of the coin BBC and you as a so-called independent news outlet should know that. So why are you not doing it? War as we know is the most destructive of all human activities and Jeremy is right in questioning such retaliatory action. May on the other hand just accepts what the US administration says and she acts as their political poodle. That is not we want in a PM and another reason why the man of 'reasonableness' Jeremy Corbyn will make a far safer' and better prime minister than May. For once war is effective, it is very hard to stop as history has shown us all who are old enough to witness such death and destruction that war unleashes. And we know also that ministers and politicians (who are always safe and nowhere near the carnage of war) do not lose their lives in fighting for so-called democracy and their perceived threats, but normal working and middle class people who account for 90% of the make-up of the British people.

That probably explains the use of two chemical weapons at the same time. The real issue for me is not that the Syrian regime would use such weapons they have a long record of doing so but they declared, with Russian support, that they had destroyed/removed their stockpile of chemical weapons. So either they have retained undeclared stocks of chemical weapons in breach of agreed, even by Russia, UN resolutions or have acquired new stocks if so from where? There is no evidence that backs up the Russian's claim that a weapons store was hit and the pattern and distribution of casualties does not support that hypothesis either. The UN Security Council has consistently failed to protect the people of Syria mainly because of Russian & Chinese vetos of resolutions.

How will we fill the skills gaps that are emerging, now that many EU citizens are going home before Brexit has even got into full flow? If we don't help everyone, the poor kids (like mine), will end up rail roaded into fruit picking, while the kids with the private educations and parents in high places will have the money to walk straight into higher education, and the social power to get them into better universities. We might be poor, but my child is not stupid, so why should him, and his peers, even the ones with the parents that smoke and drink, not get to play on the same playing field?

Our local private school just closed because it's education quality was dire, but it was still a year. Worse than the LA schools. Maybe we should charge private schools a levy from their profit rather than hit the parents?

Getting through to the youngest of generations, educating them on how to behave and be valuable members of society regardless of their upbringing and social status is the way to ensure that future generations don't fall back on living on handouts through choice or resorting to criminality. If their parents are going to be useless then the schools should at least inspire them to want to follow a brighter, alternative path and to show them how to access it. I'm not sure offering school meals to all children is necessary and it should probably be means tested, however I do like the idea that children whose parents are failing them could be nurtured and fed properly.

It's the same with making my own clothes; the cost of fabrics and notions make it much cheaper to buy from the high street. In fact I often buy a cheap items from Primark just for the Zips/buttons because it's cheaper than buying these notions in a haberdashery. Nice fabric is particularly pricey. All these people who spout crap about self-sufficiency have obviously never tried it. It's a popular middle-class hobby because outlay costs are too expensive for poor families.

Most of the meals are ok - nothing I've ever had major issues with, and fairly healthy with the odd treat meal like Pizza and chips thrown in every now and then - but my kids still prefer to have a packed lunch most of the time to the school dinners (mainly because they are really hungry kids and get far more in a packed lunch than they do in a school meal - and before anyone rude comments none of my boys are overweight, they have always been bang on weight for height, they are just growing boys and do a lot of sport so need a lot to eat). It would be a shame for this to be rolled out for all primary ages and then largely be unused by parents - would that money then just be surplus? Seems a shame when there is a lot more in education that could use the cash - such as support for kids with special needs in schools, or even just for basic equipment to use in lessons (and those that really need the meals are in receipt of them anyway). Maybe making it more thorougly means tested might be the answer - when I was younger you could only get FSM if you were on income support or equivalent, but there are plenty of working families on low incomes that could use the help - deciding eligibility through receipt of a particular benefit is the problem I think. My oldest confessed to me that he had been sharing his packed lunch with a boy in his class since he started P4 as his parents cannot afford the school meal ( .75 a day) and also cannot afford to give him much more than a sandwich in his packed lunch, I know his mum is a single parent who works but just struggles to make ends meet.

The full report on the 2012 study is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/184047/DFE-RR227.pdf From P150-151 ""The universal pilot approach cost .1 million in Newham and .6 million in Durham, equivalent to around per primary school pupil per year.
