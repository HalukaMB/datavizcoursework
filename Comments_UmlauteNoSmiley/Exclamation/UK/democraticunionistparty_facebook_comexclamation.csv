Northern Ireland actually came into being in 1921, before the rest of Ireland seperated from the UK.

It was also passed by the illigitimate Government in Dublin, as well as the legitimate Irish Parliament, the UK Westminster Government in Parliament and the UK House of Lords. The Irish Free State certainly had democratic legitimacy but it was not put to a vote for the whole population of the Irish Free State. The Irish Free State came into existance in 1922. Northern Ireland, having already been established with the consent of its people in 1921 was irrelevent to the Irish Free State decision. Although the Irish Free State electors did not have a referendum as such, they certainly overwhelmingly backed the politicians who set up the Irish Free State in the next election there.'",175,0,0.0

My thoughts also have been compare 20 or so years of terror from the IRA to the 800 years of terror from England. I think it's easy for me to say we should have unity by any means however I am trying to change that view point and to be honest it was Sinn F who made me start to change that thought. Because they keep campaigning for equal rights for all Irish and I am working on realizing there are some Irish that don't want a united Ireland at this time and so I wanted to understand what the was that those people thought so we could move twords a united Ireland which would be good for all Irish.""",285,0,0.0

I wouldn,t want an all Ireland and be under Rome and also I think we are much better off here but the ballot box is the only answer I go down south quite often and find the Irish people great people who just want to make a living I also think SF played on the Brexit vote as well and there is also more people of different nationalities here now too.But if an united Ireland came about civil war is not the answer'",143,0,0.0

I am very proud of my Irish heritage and I am certain if it wasn't for my Irish blood I wouldn't be half as strong as I am. Furthermore I believe that it is evident god intended Ireland to be one nation by the fact that it is one island. I believe as it was stated in the proclamation that the right to Ireland is to the Irish people that they are equal united and free. That they are undivided by differences fostered by an alien government in the past. I believe in the words of Pearse that Ireland unfree will never be at peace. That's why I am here to try to understand the point of view of the Irish in the north so that when Ireland moves for her freedom I will be educated on what it will take for everyone to feel included. Like I said earlier as someone you supports the fight for a united 32 county Ireland I am very sorry for the way the IRA operated between the 70's and 90's it is regrettable whenever an innocent life is taken. Of course we're still waiting on an apology from England for the millions of lives taken through out history in several nations around the globe including ireland. I do concern myself with my own politics, however we in America aren't under English rule. we took care of that a long time ago! If you are Irish I consider you my sister and friend as I have with Hetty although we have different ideas I greatly respect and appreciate her position and I hope that whatever happens for Ireland in the future is good for her as well as any Irish person north or south, Catholic or Protestant. As is outlined in the proclamation. If you are English it is my opinion that you certainly could feel welcomed in Ireland however should respect the fact that Ireland belongs to the Irish. As I believe anyone should respect that England belongs to the English and Scotland the Scots for that matter. Obviously I have heard of the UK and NI, thank you for your concern though, I do appreciate your thoughtfulness especially concidering our differences. Certainly you have a right to be proud of your heritage as I am mine, and entitled to your opinion as I am as well. Which is that a proud Englishman/woman must be an uneducated Englishman/woman lol.

He was prepared to, and did divide the Unionist community, a division that has deepened over the years. To end up in a situation, as we witnessed in this election, where the leader of the UUP, urged through his actions, for Unionists to transfer votes to a Nationalist party, to further his personal ambition, was akin to Paisley's actions of the past, dividing Unionism. We are now at the last chance saloon, and unless we can recover Unionist unity, with individuals devoid of greed and personal ambition, with a genuine desire to strengthen our position in the Union, we have lost the battle.

Johns Hopkins Psychiatrist Drops Major TRUTH BOMB About Transgenders Liberals Are FURIOUS Like this article? 43.2KSHARES Share Tweet Pin Link Dean James III% AMERICA\'S FREEDOM FIGHTERS Dr. Paul R. McHugh, the Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University and former psychiatrist -chief for Johns Hopkins Hospital has just dropped a bomb on Obama, liberals and transgenders. Dr. McHugh, who has studied transgendered people for 40 years, said it is a scientific fact that ""transgendered men do not become women, nor do transgendered women become men."" Michael W. Chapman at CNS News has more: All such people, Dr. McHugh explained in an article for The Witherspoon Institute, ""become feminized men or masculinized women, counterfeits or impersonators of the sex with which they \'identify.\'"" Dr. McHugh, who was psychiatrist-in-chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital for 26 years, the medical institute that had initially pioneered sex-change surgery and later ceased the practice stressed that the cultural meme, or idea that ""one\'s sex is fluid and a matter of choice"" is extremely damaging, especially to young people. The idea that one\'s sexuality is a feeling and not a biological fact ""is doing much damage to families, adolescents, and children and should be confronted as an opinion without biological foundation wherever it emerges,"" said Dr. McHugh in his article. ""Both the state and federal governments are actively seeking to block any treatments that can be construed as challenging the assumptions and choices of transgendered youngsters."" He points out what senior adviser to President Obama, Valerie Jarrett said- ""As part of our dedication to protecting America\'s youth, this administration supports efforts to ban the use of conversion therapy for minors."" Think about that for a second. Obama doesn\'t want these kids to get the help they need and wants the government to control what happens. It\'s insane. Dr. McHugh says those who want to change their gender suffer from a psychological condition rather than a biological matter. ""In fact, gender dysphoria official psychiatric term for feeling oneself to be of the opposite sex in the family of similarly disordered assumptions about the body, such as anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder,"" said McHugh. ""Its treatment should not be directed at the body as with surgery and hormones any more than one treats obesity-fearing anorexic patients with liposuction,"" he said. Michele Hickford at Allen B. West has more: Perhaps the most tragic part of this new trend is the consequence. After the immense pain and hardship of transitioning, a high percentage of transgendered individuals eventually take their own lives. When ""the tumult and shouting dies,"" McHugh continued, ""it proves not easy nor wise to live in a counterfeit sexual garb. The most thorough follow-up of sex-reassigned people over 30 years and conducted in Sweden, where the culture is strongly supportive of the transgendered their lifelong mental unrest."" ""Ten to 15 years after surgical reassignment, the suicide rate of those who had undergone sex-reassignment surgery rose to 20 times that of comparable peers,"" said McHugh. I will probably get hammered by our liberal readers for apparently ""trivializing"" this issue, but here I go anyway When I was growing up in the \'70\'s there was a TV commercial for Chiffon margarine, which apparently tasted just like butter it\'s not. The very last (and very famous) line from the commercial was ""It\'s not nice to fool Mother Nature."" Apparently that is still the case. Spot on. Folks, Obama has done so much damage to our nation that it\'s going to take one hell of a strong president to get our country back on track.

"'Something very, very controversial a friend of mine posted on this page,which has since been removed. I wonder why? -. ""So it\'s a week since I posted my passionate primary political rant with all my views on the election and I have since been embroiled in some banter, debate and discussion with people I don\'t know. Ok. I admit I\'m voting Alliance but I have been posting some thought provoking comments on both the SF/ DUP facebook page, nothing negative, just asking questions, promoting ideas, alternatives They are the parties I have issues with. Of note I have been putting DUP supporters minds at rest as they seem to be obsessed with impending unification (eg one poor old lady stated SF number one and only priority was a united Ireland) So I was able to reply to her quoting their manifesto of which it is one vague paragraph. I reminded her that UK and RoI would have to agree and it was years away.(She will be long gone!) I suggested she consider other parties if she was voting out of fear now I have assuaged her worry. Imagine my surprise, my confusion, my anger when yesterday when I went looking for her feedback I find that every single comment I had ever made on the DUP facebook was removed and I was not longer permitted to comment on their page!!!!! That in itself is pretty outrageous but what is worse is the DUP are happy to leave vile and nasty comments from nationalists about the party leader, calling her a pig, about her short hair, clothes, etc they are happy to leave comments from nationalists ""our day is coming/ SF first minister/ United Ireland"" They leave all the comments from their supporters warning not to split the unionist vote "" If you don\'t vote DUP youll get a SF first minister"" They leave nasty comments from supporters about how useless the UUP are. MY QUESTION- why leave all that negativity but remove my questions and neutral commentary? MY (SUGGESTED) ANSWER- I believe it is an extension of their manifesto a campaign built on scaring people to vote for them through fear of what might happen if they don\'t vote for them. I appreciate it is their site and their control, but surely this is censorship and control, in fact what they are leaving behind is cleverly disguised propaganda. Can their members not be trusted to consider other options? Is this North Korea? If you know of DUP supporters who might like to open their minds please share, talk to, or encourage because this doesn\'t seem fair or right to me. How do we at least talk to these people and get the debate off the ground ? Freedom of Expression ..NO WAIT . Have just noted that Arlene Foster has also blocked me and my commentaries on her page- ALL GONE.'",481,6,0.012474012474012475

"""If you care to read my original post, I alluded to the fact that Ian paisley Snr stirred sectarian hatred and incited violence. I did not imply that he was the operating commander of any terrorist group. There is incontrovertible evidence of his toxic hate speech and actions as part of the various paramilitary organisations that he formed or was involved with. These include the Ulster Protestant Action, the Ulster Protestant Volunteers, Third force and the Ulster Resistance. Do you not know anything about Northern Irish history? This is all well documented, the speeches, pictures and film footage is all available online. I will give you a few examples to illustrate my point and you can decide if you still think that he was not responsible for inciting any violence or stirring sectarian tensions. I do however suggest that you do a bit more thorough reading about this. As part of the UPA, he was responsible for naming the addresses of catholic businesses and homes during a rally. These were later attacked and burnt out and 'taigs out' painted on their walls. He was also involved in campaigning for catholic families to be denied access to social housing. He formed the UPV, many of whose members were also in the UVF and who attended each other's marches and rallies. He publicly thanked the UVF for attending a march in 1966, shortly after which they launched an indiscrimate campaign of petrol bombing catholic homes and murdering innocent Catholics. In 1968 he roused a rabble of 500 men with cudgels to counter a civil rights march in Armagh. He was the main thrust of a workers strike which was aimed at paralysing the whole country for 2 weeks in 1974 in opposition to the sunningdale agreement. The strikers targeted fellow protestants who refused to stop working and culminated in loyalists bombing in Dublin and Monaghan, killing 33 innocent people. He later organised another strike in 1977, boasting that he had personally taken part in the patrols during a speech in Westminster. During this strike a loyalist bus driver was murdered for continuing to work and A UDR soldier was killed in a bomb targeted at a petrol station for staying open. Need I go on? (there is a LOT more) The point is, it stinks of hypocrisy for the DUP to go on saying that we need to teach our children that terrorism was never justified, when Paisley himself was responsible for inspiring some of that terrorism. You keep going back to mentioning other groups, who no doubt were at times equally or more responsible for the wrongs of the past. They seem to be trying to move forward. More than can be said for the DUP who Just want to keep dragging everyone back into the 'them and us' default setting.

"'Most people are not aware of the facts stated below, therefore I am sharing this with all of you. *Here is something to think about**, and why so many Americans support Donald Trump !!* (This information has all been checked, then double checked... it is 100% Correct.) That\'s why there is such an alarm within US government, since Trump\'s statement about temporary suspension of migration of Muslims to US till US authorities make sure there is a proper concept of safe penetration of US territory. People are stunned to learn that the head of the U.S. CIA is a Muslim! Do hope this wakes up some! You mean until it hits you like a ton of bricks read it again, until you understand! We now have a Muslim government. John Brennan, current head of the CIA converted to Islam while stationed in Saudi Arabia. Obama\'s top adviser, Valerie Jarrett, is a Muslim who was born in Iran where her parents still live. Hillary Clinton\'s top adviser, Huma Abedin is a Muslim, whose mother and brother are involved in the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Assistant Secretary for Policy Development for Homeland Security, Arif Aikhan, is a Muslim. Homeland Security Adviser, Mohammed Elibiary, is a Muslim. Obama adviser and founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Salam al-Marayati, is a Muslim. Obama\'s Sharia Czar, Imam Mohamed Magid, of the Islamic Society of North America is a Muslim.. Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships, Eboo Patel, is a Muslim. 1/13/15:?? Nancy Pelosi announced she will appoint Rep Andre Carson, D-Ind, as the first Muslim lawmaker on the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. It would make Carson the first Muslim to serve on the committee that receives intelligence on the threat of Islamic militants in the Middle East! He has suggested that U.S. schools should be modeled after Islamic madrassas, where education is based on the Quran!!! And last but not least, our closet Muslim himself, Barack Hussein Obama. It\'s questionable if Obama ever officially took the oath of office when he was sworn in. He didn\'t repeat the oath properly to defend ournation and our Constitution. Later the Democrats claimed he was given the oath again in private. CIA director John Brennan took his oath on a copy of the Constitution, not a Bible..?? Valarie Jarret wrote her college thesis on how she wanted to change America into a Muslim friendly nation and she is a Obama top advisor. Congressman, Keith Ellison took his oath on a copy of the Qur\'an. Congresswoman Michele Bachman was vilified and verbally tarred and feathered by Democrats when she voiced her concern about Muslims taking over our government. Considering all these appointments, it would explain why Obama and his minions are systematically destroying our nation, supporting radical Muslim groups worldwide, opening our southern border, and turning a blind eye to the genocide being perpetrated on Christians all over Africa and the Middle East. The more damage Obama does, the more arrogant he\'s become! Our nation and our government has been infiltrated by people who want to destroy us. It can only get worse! If you fail to pass this one on, there\'s something wrong.. Somewhere! In his book he said, ""if it comes down to it, I would side with the Muslims"". (And still, some insist he isn\'t Muslim!)

If you\'re over 50, you lived through it, so share it with those under 50. Amazing to me how much I had forgotten!When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn\'t even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno husband Bill described her selection as ""my worst mistake."" Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovery of Ms. Guanier\'s radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration.Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.Many younger votes will have no knowledge of ""Travelgate."" Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were:She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr\'s investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary\'s game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for \'lying under oath\' to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, ""I do not recall,"" ""I have no recollection,"" and ""I don\'t know"" a total of 56 times while under oath.After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen.Now we are exposed to the destruction of possibly incriminating emails while Hillary was Secretary of State and the ""pay to play"" schemes of the Clinton Foundation we have no idea what shoe will fall next.

"'Go Trump! Hillary is a chronic liar, corrupt, and incompetent & should be behind bars now! Trump all the way! If you\'re under 50 you really need to read this. If you\'re over 50, you lived through it, so share it with those under 50. Amazing to me how much I had forgotten!When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn\'t even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno husband Bill described her selection as ""my worst mistake."" Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovery of Ms. Guanier\'s radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration.Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.Many younger votes will have no knowledge of ""Travelgate."" Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were:She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr\'s investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary\'s game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for \'lying under oath\' to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, ""I do not recall,"" ""I have no recollection,"" and ""I don\'t know"" a total of 56 times while under oath.After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen.Now we are exposed to the destruction of possibly incriminating emails while Hillary was Secretary of State and the ""pay to play"" schemes of the Clinton Foundation we have no idea what shoe will fall next. But to her loyal fans (supporters) - I guess in her own words ""what difference does it make?"" I guess being a female Democrat is all that matters. By the way, I\'d post the same if she were a Republican. You see, she\'s already been in the White House, she has a record we can review.Hillary for prison 2016 would be a good start to help make America safe again.'",740,4,0.005405405405405406

"'Brexit The young, the educated, the Londoners, the Scots, the Welsh, the Northern Irish, the Irish, Cypriots and Maltese must vote to remain If Britain chooses to withdraw from the European Union, it will bring to an end a tempestuous relationship between the individualist leaning Brits and more Communatarian rest of the continent. Within Britain it is clear that strong majorities exist for remaining in the EU in Scotland and in Northern Ireland and to a lesser extent in Wales. Digging deeper, London wishes strongly to remain and the rest of England slightly to strongly negative. Poor little England. What is astonishing is that, in England, those regions that are least affected by the migration which is portrayed as the catalyst of this crisis, are the most vehement in their refusal to consider reasoned argument on the subject. London, a vibrant and international city, full of migrants, is the most positive part of England in favour of remaining in Europe. Despite the 2011 census showing its ethnic makeup is less than 45% British (which includes Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland), far from feeling threatened by diversity, the English capital clearly does not share UKIPs view that England would be better off out. This most densely populated part of England does not feel there is a lack of space or jobs and does not see its culture threatened by migrants. Comparing the capital to the rural counties from where distressing reports of the abuse of migrant workers emerge regularly, we already have a feeling that the contradictory views and behaviour of the leave-shires lack morality whichever way we look at them. The antics of Boris Johnson who has, with great energy to give him his due, taken over from the political fringe occupied by the failed UKIP party in flying the Leave flag and are an embarrasment. The unavoidable comparisons with the other blonde mop-top go deeper than dodgy hair styles. While Trump is out to buy the US presidency with money and barely disguised gung-ho racism, Johnson, having lost his position as Mayor of London clearly sees an opportunity in the Leave campaign to challenge for ladership of the Tory party and a path to being Prime Minister. That alone should be enough to ring alarm bells regarding his judgement of whats best for Britain. The narrow education that is typical in English schools, where the majority of young people do not learn a foreign language, or economics, or geography, or history to the A levels, creates a fertile ground for those who wish to spread untruth, myths and outrageous lies about the European project. It is imperfect. So is the British take on democracy. But it has delivered peace, growth, freedom of movement and human rights. It is has had a mondernising and positive influence on every country it has touched. Yes there are differences of approach and views and yes it sometimes takes years to arrive at less than perfect compromises. But it does achiecve that, where otherwise there would be nothing. If the UK drops out of Europe, where will the Foreign Direct Investment to Britain go? We can expect a certain amount to go there regardless, but a large part of that investment is prdicated on the UK providing access to the EU market with tarifs or trade barriers. It is also predicated on the current situation where the pound does not swing wildly relative to the Euro. Ireland and the Netherlands seem likely targets for companies. As the OECD reports, (http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/FDI-in-Figures-April-2016.pdf) ""OECD FDI inflows almost doubled compared to 2014, most ly due to large inflows in Ireland, the Netherlands , Switzerland and the United States . Investors from those countries were also responsible for the 35 % increase in OECD outflows. These countries appear among the top destinations and top sources of FDI worldwide in 2015."" It cannot be a good thing for the UK to become less attractive as a destination for investment just as it chooses to go it alone. And that\'s the nub of it. If Britain votes to leave the EU, they will be alone. Remaining a member of NATO will not keep people in jobs, or ensure British exports have free access to the single biggest market in the world. Everyone who\'s opinion is based on science rather than emotion agrees from UK based business leaders, politicans from all parties except UKIP and the DUP, trade unions, economic forecasters and academics. The wider world\'s most respected and influential economic organisations and leaders are of one voice - to leave would be anything from foolish to disastrous. Even President Obama, who\'s office would not usually pronounce on such sovereign discussions has made clear that this would damage the UKs position with the US. In fact, internationally, the US mop-head Trump appears to be Johnson\'s only ally there. How long before he suggests that he will flood the Channel Tunnel and make the French pay for it? Even the citizens of Europe are, in every other EU country positive they want the UK to remain. Johnson\'s charge that there is a \'democratic void\' in Europe is worth discussing, but so to is the faulty democracry present in many EU states, the UK included, where winning as little as 38% of the vote can lead to overwhelming majorities in our nations parliaments. That is a subject for another day. For now, let us hope that the young, the educated, the Londoners, the Scots, the Welsh, the Northern Irish, the Irish, Cypriots and Maltese in Britain all come out in vast numbers because they are the ones who can ensure a positive result for Britain, for Ireland and for Europe - a continent united. If you know anyone with a vote - encourage them to vote to remain. Anything else would be very bad for the UK. TDH'",974,0,0.0
