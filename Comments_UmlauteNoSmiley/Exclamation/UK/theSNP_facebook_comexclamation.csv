This is the biggest transfer of powers since devolution began and the Scottish Government have always been clear that by the end of this parliamentary term they will be delivering the devolved benefits they will have responsibility for.This will mean delivering more payments in a week than the Scottish Government currently does in a year. That is complex and means they need to pass new laws and build the required infrastructure so that the Scottish Government can deliver the benefits instead of the DWP. As 1.4 million people rely on these benefits they have to make sure they get that in place and get it right for them ensuring that everyone reliant on benefits receives the money to which they are entitled on the day when it is due. That's why they have always been clear that the safe and secure transition of the devolved benefits is an absolute priority. They will protect disability benefits, not cut them, and will ensure that they remain non-means tested.and establish a Scottish Social Security Agency with dignity and respect at its heart(bye bye Atos)! During the time that benefits are being transferred to Scotland, any child in receipt of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) will be given an automatic award of that DLA to age 18 unless they don't want it. This will allow for continuity for families whilst the transfer of benefits takes place. They will also bring back long term awards for those with long term conditions or disabilities establishing a Disability Benefits Assessment Commission to provide recommendations and guidance on how often assessments should be, what conditions should be given an automatic or lifetime awards, and eligibility criteria.(again bye Atos)! In addition, the rate of Carer's Allowance will e raised to the same level as Jobseeker's Allowance, giving carers an extra each year. To recognise higher costs of living, they will also increase Carer's Allowance further for those looking after more than one disabled child, as well as extending Winter Fuel Payments to families who have severely disabled children.They will also abolish the 84 day-rule, which currently means that severely ill or disabled children needing more than 84 days hospitalisation or medical treatment lose both Disability Living Allowance and Carer's Allowance.

Tory economics: Save ,000 in benefit payments at a cost of only ,000 Jan Davies suffers from multiple sclerosis but she has a job working for HMRC in East Kilbride which she commutes to four days a week. In March 2017 the DWP informed her that she was being stripped of her disability benefits after a snap reassessment of her benefits claim had found that she does not need her motability car in order to live independently. After taking advice from her local MP Jan turned to the DWP\'s Access to Work scheme, which subsequently awarded her ,133.71 over the course of three years in order to pay for taxis to and from work! In order to save the ,000 it would have cost to let Jan keep her motability car the Tory administered DWP are willing to shell out over ten times the amount on paying taxis to chauffeur her to and from work! This is astounding stuff from the Tories. They love to dress themselves up as ""the party of economic competence"", but this case makes it look like their campaign of confiscating an average of 800 motability cars a week is motivated more by malice than any intention to actually save money. The ridiculous decision to snatch Jan\'s motability car to save less than ,000 and then stump up over ,000 for taxis also makes a mockery of the Tories absurd ""making work pay"" rhetoric too. The only people this farce seems to be making work pay for are the taxi companies of Ayrshire. This farcical situation is far from the only example of Tories creating ridiculous false economies. Back in 2010 the Tory environment minister Caroline Spelman decided to save money by slashing flood defence spending, despite the evidence showing that every spent on flood defences saves in future economic damage. Over the next few years various parts of the UK to be hit by huge floods, including places that had their flood defence renewal schemes cancelled by Spelman\'s bonkers austerity cuts. In August 2016 she was rewarded for this lunacy with a DBE! It\'s also worth remembering that various other aspects of the Tories\' welfare reforms cost way more than they save. The demeaning, dehumanising and discriminatory Work Capacity Assessment regime costs way more in corporate outsourcing fees than it can ever possibly save in reduced benefits payments, and the Tories\' savage sanctions regime also costs way more to administer than it saves in reduced welfare payments. Jan is just one amongst tens of thousands of disabled people who have had their motability cars confiscated by the Tories. Given their outrageous track record of wasting taxpayers money on malicious and misguided schemes it would take wilful ignorance to excuse this case as an isolated case of incompetence, and a great deal of gullibility to continue believing in the myth of Tory economic competence.'",485,3,0.006185567010309278

"""Promoting trade with Scotland in the US By Nicola Sturgeon, 10/04/17 The US is Scotland's biggest inward investor and one of our major export markets. It's also where many of our tourists and international students come from. Those are just some of the reasons it's important that we continue to build good relationships in the US and promote Scotland as a place to live, work, invest and visit. It's part of my job to make sure we take every opportunity to build on those links. Over the last week in California and New York, I've met with representatives of some of our key current investors, and potential new investors, to ensure they know how committed we are to building a strong economy, and to remaining an open and welcoming country against the backdrop of Brexit. We have long had strong interest from US companies in our financial services sector, but increasingly there's interest in our technology sectors too. Edinburgh had more tech start-ups per head than London in 2015 - and we want that to keep going. One of the most exciting discussions I took part in was at Stanford University who are working in partnership with five Scottish universities to expose science and technology students to the entrepreneurial environment of Silicon Valley, encouraging them to turn problem solving science into profitable businesses. Whilst there I met with one investment company, Par Equity, who are putting $125 million into an investment fund to bring health technology start ups to Scotland and take Scottish start ups to the US market. My visit wasn't just about inward investment in Scotland, it was also about helping Scottish companies into the American market. And in a few weeks 12 female CEOs of Scottish firms will be landing in California to make their pitches to some of the investors I met, to try to secure the funding they need to grow their businesses at home and sell their products in the US. This focus on technology is vital for the future of Scotland's economy. Indeed, following my announcement a few weeks ago that the Scottish Government will be investing million in supporting businesses to improve the digital skills of their staff, I took a look at The Flat Iron School, a training programme in New York City that helps people into technology jobs exactly the kind of programme we will be investing in here at home. But our economy isn't just about the science and technology. Our natural assets food and drink, gorgeous scenery and inspiring history are also hugely important. So it was exciting to hear from Marriot Hotels about their plans to build seven new hotels in Scotland to meet growing demand from visitors to our shores, and also to join TripAdvisor and Visit Scotland at the Carnegie Hall to announce their partnership a European first to promote Scotland as a place to visit. And it's always a pleasure to promote Scotland's food and drink industry, which achieved over $1 billion of food and drink exports to the US last year a figure that is set to grow. Promoting Scotland overseas is a central part of being First Minister and as I've travelled across the US this week it's clear to me there's a big appetite for all that Scotland has to offer...""",550,0,0.0

Taking on teaching assistants instead!! That is how important your children are to the Westminster parties!!! So please get your facts correct before posting Westminster propaganda!!!

When the Tories took over, the UK's borrowing was around Billion not its at .7Trillion and rising at an astronomical rate. By 2022, they say it will be over pounds. Scotland can't borrow, it gets an 'allowance' each year, The Block Grant and the UK get more from the Scottish economy than we gets back. As soon as independence is agreed after the vote for it, Scotland will inherit as their part of the share of the UK assets, which are rightly ours. We would have no debt, 95% of the oil and with getting rid of Trident, we'd not only have the massive oil fields off Shetland but also the equally large one in the Clyde estuary. We would manage the oil much better than the Uk has and not let the big oil companies off with paying tax as the UK has done, we in the UK's don't make much out of oil, not because it's not worth anything but that the UK gov has let off the big oil companies, making them richer.

Thankfully, these things aren\'t known to happen to LGBT people in our country, because of the rights protections we have here, hence why they\'re valid and important. The reason the SNP brag about this is because other countries are woefully behind; When you can find videos online of heterosexuals being scalped, burned and beaten simply because of their orientation (as is what often happens to transgender and gay people in Brazil, for example) then you can argue for this myth that is the oppression of heterosexuals on an international level! Progress is linear, and it started with straight people marginalising LGBT people, not the other way around. ""Oh look at me"", knowing basic sociological, political history. I agree with everything you stand for besides this. I too think more focus needs to be shifted onto poverty and economical issues.

Yes, we need more doctors, yes we need more nurses and careers, but there is a limit on how much you can tax people before they get up and leave. It is also a fact that the less you tax people, the more they have to spend, the more they buy in the shops, the more jobs created, the more tax you collect. The Tory government have followed that policy by increasing borrowing in order to maintain services without increasing taxes. No we will consider an independent Scotland. We already have difference between what we raise in taxes and what we spend on social welfare, we could borrow the , but that would be another next year, and again the year after. So maybe we borrow a bit, and raise taxes to make up the difference. But, ad we have jus said, raising taxes cuts spending. So we we will also have to cut welfare spending, and I don't mean tinkering at the edges.

Fact: Scotland has shown its revulsion time and time again to nuclear weapons but they place them here against our countries wishes. A recent contingency report was carried out about the feasibility of relocating them in Portsmouth. The report stated that it was unfeasible because the detrimental risk to the area of an incident was too high.

Fact: The Clair Oil Field is about to open it\'s 3rd phase, and on its own has over 650 million barrels which will be extracted over 20+ years with production reaching a hundred thousand barrels a day! Fact: Scotland gives more to Westminster than it gets back. Do you really think they\'d be so keen to keep us if we were being subsidised like they\'d have us believe?

After it triumphed with the right, the left bought into it, so no one has thought about what might replace it. On the face of it, it would seem that the globalisation of company and tax rules would tackle the hiding of money, so a resurgent nationalism would seem the last thing that might help - it will exacerbate the very economic problems that have led people to a nationalist position.

It has nothing whatsoever to do with Salmond or the snp. Don\'t let political ignorance ruin this opportunity. Do you know... This is the UK\'s legacy of success in our history of being better-together: The UK has the 3rd lowest pensions in the 34 OECD countries of the world The UK has the single most expensive childcare in the European Union The UK has the second lowest-paid economy in the entire developed world The UK has the 3rd longest working hours in the EU The UK has the lowest number of holidays in the EU The UK has the 8th highest gender inequality pay gap out of the EU\'s 28 countries The UK has the highest likelihood of poverty in disablement in the EU The UK has the highest rail prices in Europe The UK has the second highest housing cost in Europe The UK has the highest fuel poverty rates in Europe. The UK is the 4th highest country of wealth inequality in the entire planet! Surely these awful figures should not be possible when you read the Scottish statistics above... Finally, did you know that in all of the UK elections for Westminster ever!... Not one vote cast in SCOTLAND has ever mattered! Because of the Westminster numbers, whatever government England votes for, the UK gets. So we have no democracy here!!! 4 decades of tory rule that we voted against is proof enough, and our defiance was punished by the closure of all the mines; closure of all the steelworks; closure of all the shipyards losing thousands of jobs. The term used by Thatcher when these industries needed some assistance was ""let the markets decide"". Funny how when the greedy banks collapsed everywhere they were bailed out to the tune of over a trillion pounds of our money... Not a mention of ""let the markets decide"". FACTS: Fact: Scotland has an oil boom waiting to happen on the West Coast, but Michael Hesaltine signed a cessation of any form of oil exploration in the entire area in the 80\'s to make way for nuclear submarines which Scotland doesn\'t want! Fact: Scotland has shown its revulsion time and time again to nuclear weapons but they place them here against our countries wishes. A recent contingency report was carried out about the feasibility of relocating them in Portsmouth. The report stated that it was unfeasible because the detrimental risk to the area of an incident was too high. (Ok for the Clyde though) Fact: Scotland, with only 1 Tory MP, was forced to take the shocking attack on the poor & disabled called The Bedroom Tax, even though Holyrood voted to utterly reject this awful tax on the poor. Westminster gave us it anyway! Fact: We are led to believe that the oil in our waters is finished and its a dying industry. Yet 13.5 billion has been invested by oil companies in the last 2 years alone! Fact: The Clair Oil Field is about to open it\'s 3rd phase, and on its own has over 650 million barrels which will be extracted over 20+ years with production reaching a hundred thousand barrels a day! Fact: Scotland gives more to Westminster than it gets back. Do you really think they\'d be so keen to keep us if we were being subsidised like they\'d have us believe? Fact: Westminster has amassed over .3 trillion debt and still growing at nearly a second. Thats another million today alone which YOU will have to pay for.

And finally we are blessed to have 1.5 trillion pounds - ,500,000,000,000 worth of oil and gas reserves. All of this, yet only 8.3% of The UK\'s population... IGNORANCE... If you hear anyone saying ""i don\'t like Alex Salmond"" or ""I don\'t like the SNP""...This vote is about Scotland\'s right to elect it\'s own government... It has nothing whatsoever to do with Salmond or the snp. Don\'t let political ignorance ruin this opportunity. Do you know... This is the UK\'s legacy of success in our history of being better-together: The UK has the 3rd lowest pensions in the 34 OECD countries of the world The UK has the single most expensive childcare in the European Union The UK has the second lowest-paid economy in the entire developed world The UK has the 3rd longest working hours in the EU The UK has the lowest number of holidays in the EU The UK has the 8th highest gender inequality pay gap out of the EU\'s 28 countries The UK has the highest likelihood of poverty in disablement in the EU The UK has the highest rail prices in Europe The UK has the second highest housing cost in Europe The UK has the highest fuel poverty rates in Europe. The UK is the 4th highest country of wealth inequality in the entire planet! Surely these awful figures should not be possible when you read the Scottish statistics above... Finally, did you know that in all of the UK elections for Westminster ever!... Not one vote cast in SCOTLAND has ever mattered! Because of the Westminster numbers, whatever government England votes for, the UK gets. So we have no democracy here!!! 4 decades of tory rule that we voted against is proof enough, and our defiance was punished by the closure of all the mines; closure of all the steelworks; closure of all the shipyards losing thousands of jobs. The term used by Thatcher when these industries needed some assistance was ""let the markets decide"". Funny how when the greedy banks collapsed everywhere they were bailed out to the tune of over a trillion pounds of our money... Not a mention of ""let the markets decide"". FACTS: Fact: Scotland has an oil boom waiting to happen on the West Coast, but Michael Hesaltine signed a cessation of any form of oil exploration in the entire area in the 80\'s to make way for nuclear submarines which Scotland doesn\'t want! Fact: Scotland has shown its revulsion time and time again to nuclear weapons but they place them here against our countries wishes. A recent contingency report was carried out about the feasibility of relocating them in Portsmouth. The report stated that it was unfeasible because the detrimental risk to the area of an incident was too high. (Ok for the Clyde though) Fact: Scotland, with only 1 Tory MP, was forced to take the shocking attack on the poor & disabled called The Bedroom Tax, even though Holyrood voted to utterly reject this awful tax on the poor. Westminster gave us it anyway! Fact: We are led to believe that the oil in our waters is finished and its a dying industry. Yet 13.5 billion has been invested by oil companies in the last 2 years alone! Fact: The Clair Oil Field is about to open it\'s 3rd phase, and on its own has over 650 million barrels which will be extracted over 20+ years with production reaching a hundred thousand barrels a day! Fact: Scotland gives more to Westminster than it gets back. Do you really think they\'d be so keen to keep us if we were being subsidised like they\'d have us believe? Fact: Westminster has amassed over .3 trillion debt and still growing at nearly a second. Thats another million today alone which YOU will have to pay for.

In my life I have seen the Anglican Church practically destroyed by the sinful squeeze of feminist and gay crusaders. In the UK many historic Anglican Churches simply reverted back to being Roman Catholic, to avoid the ongoing smothering deadly fog that people with a leftist feninist agenda promoted in the Church. In Canada the Anglican Church fell apart. In the 1980\'s it is stated that ther were 60 declared homosexuals in priest collars attending the Toronto Synod, making their particular ""rights""the focus of the road forward, and abandoning tried and true values and traditions. Clergy and congregations alike scattered, from one end to the country to another. Former Bishop Wilkinson of Vancouver Island hopped off the Anglican wagon and became a Roman Catholic Priest, now a Bishop in fact and much admired at home and in Rome. As a female and a former priest, you must see the parallels to some extent, in theprofile of the Nicola Sturgeon support base, and those who destroyed the Anglican Church. Call my remarks rot if you will, but with THE GREATEST OF RESPECT you of all people simply must admit that the comparisons are valid, the sinful threats are the same, and that ther eis no logic whatsoever in pitching for a second indyref vote with the full intention of giving up immigration, resource taxation, border control, migration of jobs, Scottish fishing rights, and the rights to make serious and impacting laws all over to Germany and France and the little back room group who control the EU. As a priest/minister/clergy person, you surly must have the best interests of the souls in your care at heart. However your very interest in politics, The SNP and this entire political mess in the UK, is nor perhaps something you should be giving advice on. My realtives...many of them in fact, fought on the air, on the seas and on the ground in a horrific second world war to rid the UK of the bonds of slavery and oppression foisted upon them by satanic forces in Europe. Now Nicola Sturgeon ridicules and badgers and insults Prime Minister May almost daily, to promote her poison, poorly-thought-out leftist agenda.Her immigration agenda is such that Scottish culture and life could be all but wiped out in less than a decade, if her plan were to succeed. She and her english husband have hijacked the SNP, catered to the radical side, the leftists and the gay/lesbian radicals, and she will continue swing fruther left until she is stopped. She will NEVER win an agenda. This time the big money will make a concentrated effort to derail her. Scots will pay the price by losing that final decent chance to attain individual free nationhood. That freedom will never come in the EU. The EU is going to implode. With RESPECT your time might well be better spent praying for Scots and Scotland, nor standing alongside the radicals who would destroy her, as they did the once mighty Anglican Church.

I believe that the Tory party might be manipulating the situation, forcing Scotland to go for Independance now as they see it's a time where all the attention is on Brexit. I mean we have already forgotten about the Tories Austerity. Well in the media anyway. So Brexit is working well for them and its because of them introducing the public vote for it, maybe in the same scenario, the focus and excuse that Brexit is all they can work on at this time. This the Tories can use to discredit Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP, for being seen as self centered and not putting their full attention into running Scotland. The same then can be said about Theresa May and the Tories who said they can only concentrate on Brexit. It's double standards and doesn't get the Media highlighting this point. I can't totally agree with you therefore on if the SNP Government stopped working on Independance, it would make any difference to the way they are focusing on the country. I think they should be able to do both. I can't predict or see anything that shows they are not. Quite the contrary. Nicola Sturgeon is in America drumming up business and the Voice of Scotland for our country. I'm not saying the SNP is perfect or the last resort but from what I have experienced and read, Scotland has been predicted by independent financial advisers from around the world that we can thrive better on our own. Also Nicola Sturgeon is seen to be a Very Good leader. We can only take this chance as the alternative if people would only believe the facts of what negativity and harmful policies to our society and using the vulnerable to pay for the state the UK is in and which they denie. So yes another Independance vote in roughly 18 months time might be doomed to fail. I see that. But chances are it wont be in a truly democratic open minded way.

In fact, by perpetuaing that myth, that somehow women might avoid it because they think it is \'scary\' or something, you are perpetuating the anti-abortion culture which want to oppress women\'s rights, and that male-dominated narrative, that there is something bad, difficult, or disgusting about it, is part of the cause of some women taking their pregnancies into late term, when obviously, the decision is a more difficult one. Perpetuating the myth that it is so hard, or disgusting, is also making the system that provides it more incoherent, because they also have to deal with the prejudices from families, society, and the women themselves, who may have been indoctrinated with your kind of thinking. Therefore, the whole act of abortion becomes something people don\'t even talk about, and the whole thing becomes more incoherent and stigmatized. These women do talk about it: """"It was less physically traumatic than I\'d assumed it would be. It was like a heavy period, all at once.""""

"""Claire Smith -- I'm pretty sure I would not give birth to a rapist's baby, but who knows. As a man, I ask myself if I would have an abortion (eg. because I am starting in college or something), and it is not a totally clear answer. In the case of college I think I would because having a baby at that time, could affect the rest of your life, if it affects your education, and you need all the education you can get to give the child the best you can. Later in life, I think maybe I would have the baby, even if the man was not around. But a rapist's baby? I don't think so. Immediate trip to the clinic for me, if I was a woman who got raped. But then the whole stigma and complexities about rape comes in, but, again., that has more to do with stigma, and should not be part of our era. So I see how that social pressure could lead a woman to delay abortion perhaps. Perhaps that stigma by society needs to change. The whole stigma society has made around the ancient practice of abortion is also causing women to doubt wether they could do it. It would be interesting to see in which country the least stigma about abortion exists in society, and if women are more open and easy with it than they are in UK or USA. The lack of people talking about it, and the stigma that causes, is also contributing to the unpleasantness about something women have done for thousands of years.""",268,0,0.0

"'\'We\'re facing a CRISIS!\' Scotland \'on brink of RECESSION\' as Sturgeon chases independence SCOTLAND\'S economy has shrunk and teeters on the brink of recession as Nicola Sturgeon chases her dream of breaking up Britain. By TOM MARTIN PUBLISHED: 00:01, Wed, Apr 5, 2017 | UPDATED: 18:34, Wed, Apr 5, 2017 Sturgeon GRILLED over Scotland\'s major economic problems Official statistics show output contracted in the final three months of 2016 - at the same time as it grew across the UK. Another negative figure in the first quarter of this year would mean Scotland has been plunged into recession. The SNP attempted to blame Brexit for the poor performance but was rebuked by independent experts because of growth elsewhere. Economists today also warned that if the gap continues at a similar rate ministers stand to lose .6 billion in income tax receipts over the next five years. SturgeonGETTY Scotland \'on brink of RECESSION\' as Sturgeon chases dream of independence RELATED ARTICLES Scotland\'s economy DIVES in final months of 2016 FURIOUS fishermen SLAM the EU as having \'DEVASTATED\' their trade Now we see the real-life impact of her mismanagement Murdo Fraser This would rise to .1 billion of all taxes in the unlikely event of independence. The gloomy GDP figures come as the First Minister continues to push for another referendum on the country\'s future despite UK ministers signalling they will not allow one until 2022 at the earliest. Opposition MSPs urged Ms Sturgeon to ditch demands for a divisive rerun of the 2014 poll as they hit out at her ""mismanagement"" of the economy. Business leaders also challenged her SNP administration to abandon its ""high tax agenda before it is too late"". There has been widespread anger over its failure to scrap the large business supplement, which has doubled from 1.3p in the pound to 2.6p. sturgeonGETTY The Scottish economy struggled in the final quarter of 2016 It has also opted to make Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK by failing to match Chancellor Philip Hammond\'s decision to raise the threshold for paying the higher rate of income tax from ,000 to ,000. Instead, the threshold has been frozen at ,000 - meaning all higher rate taxpayers north of the Border pay a year more than those in England. Scottish Tory finance spokesman Murdo Fraser warned the country was ""facing a crisis and insisted Ms Sturgeon ""must take responsibility for this mess"". He added: ""She has made Scotland the highest-taxed part of the UK and created more instability and uncertainty with her threat of a second referendum. Now we see the real-life impact of her mismanagement. ""More than ever, Scotland needs a First Minister in charge who gets back to her desk, ends her obsession with a second referendum and focuses on her day job."" SturgeonGETTY The SNP attempted to blame Brexit for the poor performance The new data revealed Scotland\'s economic output dropped by 0.2 per cent in the three months to December - the first decline since the third quarter of 2015. The UK economy grew by 0.7 per cent over the same period. Over the 12 months to December, Scotland\'s economy grew by only 0.4 per cent - lagging behind the rate of 1.8 per cent across the whole UK. But compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, Scottish output was flat (0.0 per cent change). If the next tranche of GDP figures for Scotland due to be released in July also show output shrinking, the country will officially be in recession. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay claimed the statistics reflect the ""economic reality of the Brexit vote"". RELATED VIDEOS Nicola Sturgeon: I don\'t believe Scotland should join Eurozone Sturgeon: The will of the Scottish people MUST be respected Nicola Sturgeon: 2016 was a tumultuous year in politics He said: ""We have already seen significantly lower consumer confidence in Scotland since the vote last summer. ""Now we see that feeding through into our growth figures and all of this is before the UK actually leaves the EU."" But Professor Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute at the University of Strathclyde, said: ""At a time when the UK economy grew at 1.8 per cent over the same period, this is a serious cause for concern. ""With any Brexit uncertainty affecting the UK as well, it\'s hard to argue that Scotland\'s relatively weaker performance can be explained by the outcome of the EU referendum."" Economist John McLaren forecast income tax revenues will be between million and .6 billion lower over the next five years if Scotland\'s economy continues to lag behind the rest of the UK at rates of 0.5 per cent or 1 per cent, respectively. This stands at .1 billion for all taxes in the event of independence, but his analysis raises the prospect of further hikes or spending cuts Scotland\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (R) reacts as she leaves the chamber following a vote on the second day of the \'Scotland\'s Choice\' debate on a motion to seek the authority to hold an indpendence referendum at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh AFP/GETTY IMAGES 1 of 11 Scotland\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (R) reacts as she leaves the chamber following a vote on the second day of the \'Scotland\'s Choice\' debate on a motion to seek the authority to hold an indpendence referendum at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Scotland\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (R) reacts as she leaves the chamber following a vote on the second day of the \'Scotland\'s Choice\' debate on a motion to seek the authority to hold an indpendence referendum at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Pro-independence supporters outside Holyrood react to the vote being passed for a second referendum Julie from The Indy Girls runs to hug Lorna Taylor as they celebrate outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh after MSPs backed Nicola Sturgeon\'s call for the powers to hold a second independence referendum Julie from The Indy Girls hugs Lorna Taylor as they celebrate outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh after MSPs backed Nicola Sturgeon\'s call for the powers to hold a second independence referendum Julie from The Indy Girls hugs Lorna Taylor as they celebrate outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh after MSPs backed Nicola Sturgeon\'s call for the powers to hold a second independence referendum Independence supporters celebrate outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh after MSPs backed Nicola Sturgeon\'s call for the powers to hold a second independence referendum Pro-independence supporters outside Holyrood react to the vote being passed for a second referendum Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said: ""While the SNP continue to obsess over independence our economy has been left behind. ""These figures show the risk that Scotland will be left behind under the SNP. Unless the SNP get a grip of the economy then our public services will be hit too."" Scotland Office minister Lord Andrew Dunlop highlighted an extra .2 billion of funding for SNP ministers as a result of spending commitments for other parts of the UK and challenged them to use Holyrood\'s new powers to boost growth. He added: ""Of course, the simplest way to provide more certainty for people and businesses across Scotland would be to take a second independence referendum off the table."" Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce called for an ""urgent change"" in SNP policy. Hitting out at its stance on income tax and business rates she warned: ""It is time for the Scottish Government to abandon this high tax agenda before it is too late as these policies risk driving investment out of Scotland.""'",1264,1,0.0007911392405063291
