In fact through double taxation as we now also pay a for it through our motor tax - 66% in fact goes to water. This we accepted in the assumption that it would go toward improving our water infrastructure and quality which is very poor in on many areas and undrinkable.. however, it seems this was not the case. There have been no improvements in the service or quality despite over 1.7 billion (approx) having been collected through these taxes. Three years ago the government hastily put together a company called Irish Water plc, bought millions of second hand home water meters and began installing them at our homes with the announcement that we would soon be receiving bills (charges) for our water usage and wastage from this new company notwithstanding the fact that we arealready paying twice through taxation. An EU directive they told us that Must be obeyed. It was the straw that broke the camels back as our public services are systematically being allowed to fall into complete and utter decay and despair. We are currently operating in a third world scenario regarding health services, hospital care, homelessness, evictions, food poverty (we now have food banks and soup kitchens operating throughout the country and entire families living in hotel rooms or on the streets.. the list is endless. Meanwhile our government are busy privatising and selling off our natural resources and utilities to corporations and overseas investors while selling our debts and property off to vulture funds, all the while proclaiming to the EU and anyone who will listen that we experiencing an amazing economic recovery...All lies..only on paper and imaginary figures with nothing tangible behind them. Even though they have been caught fudging the figures nothing changes. That said, the 1% of our billionaires are tripling their wealth. And so..we finally had enough. Hence the water protests which have become about so much more than that. We've found our voices again... we are waking up in our masses.

When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.The Covenant of the Redeemer20 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.21 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.""",601,0,0.0

"'Up to the end of the 60\'s, republicans in Northern Ireland were second class citizens. Loyalists and the British were born into privilege and made sure that privilege was maintained for their offspring. For example, the Loyalist farmer always got top price for his milk, it was always rated as high cream content. In contrast, the republican farmer always got the lowest price for his milk, always rated the lowest possible, the actual quality of the milk had no bearing on the price.When Catholics or Republicans were employed in hospitals as nurses. After they qualified they were fired. That way, no republicans were able to get into a managerial position which was reserved for the Loyalists. Manny professional republicans eventually emigrated, I know many of them in Australia. Same story with Harland and Wolff shipbuilding yards, it was all controlled by Loyalists. All this discrimination led to the Loyalists being much more wealthy than the Republicans and they controlled the economy.Police and all the civil service were tightly controlled by the loyalists, it was an undeclared apartheid system.To be registered on the electoral roll, you could only do so if you were a property owner and of course with the imbalance of wealth, there was also a great imbalance in the ratio to Republican voters compared to the general population.What the Unionists could not contrive with electoral role, they used gerrymandering to add the final touches.Usually Stormont was composed of 11 unionists and one republican and in a community that was about 60% Unionists to about 40% Republican.The British army could not defeat the IRA which militarily was irrelevant compared to the might of the British Army. That is because the IRA was necessary for the people, the IRA lived in the songs, in the pubs, in the hearts of good decent people such as grandmothers and grandfathers that had for years seen them discriminated against and nobody seemed to care.Now the IRA was fighting back and admired by the normal Catholics and republicans whose only wish was to be treated fairly in their own Country. The republicans and Catholics were second class citizens in their own country and presided over by a people that did not identify with Ireland, they did not want to be called Irish but called themselves British.Yes, they were the ones the IRA stood up to and the rank and file republicans thought, finally, someone is on our side.Whilst I regret the fact that the Republicans had to fight and kill people to effect change, I make no apologies for the mistakes, when you are fighting a civil war and treated like a criminal by the ruling elite, it\'s very difficult to operate. The real mistake was made by the British, they should have stayed home.Martin McGuinness was born into the epicentre of this discrimination and was admired and revered by the victims of this discrimination.It\'s okay for those born and raised into the privilege of a one person, one vote system to condemn Martin McGuinness and/or the IRA for their actions at the time I say the following.""You don\'t know how you would have behaved in the same circumstances.I think I would have been killed long ago.What we do know is that Republicans in Northern Ireland have a much better life these days largely due to the struggles of Martin McGuinness and others like him in the IRA.'",564,0,0.0

"""Martin McGuinness will be sorely missed. When I hear the comments of the Brittish media and ignorant politicians talking of the damage done by the IRA in Britain, which I do not condone, while Brittish troops roamed the streets of my Country and Killed inocent people. Bloody Sunday was a march for 1 MAN 1 VOTE. We could continue this argument forever or do what Martin did and search for peace. I have not heard 1Irish Politician condem any Brittish paratrooper, for that I'm greatful.Well done Mary-Lou a fitting tribute.""",90,0,0.0
