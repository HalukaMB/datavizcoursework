This election was not about that, it was about the here and now, about RHI, accountability and competency in government. A transfer at this election to SDLP was not a vote for a united Ireland. A protest vote, a kick up the bum, whatever way you want to see it. Also for two parties who want to power share, who signed up to it. Yes it should have been handled better, hindsight and all that. I think Mike wanted to get away from the simply Union at all costs strategy of voting. As regards Sinn Feins vote.

I do however, believe that Sinn Fein seized the opportunity of the RHI debacle, to strike a blow against Unionism. Read posts by Alex Maskey that confirm their true intentions. The problem we now face, is that Sinn Fein are emboldened by the result, and regardless of the reasons, of no doubt well intentioned people, they will use it to further their own agenda, no party is better at spin, and rewriting history. Involuntary coalition is always going to cause problems, and is in reality unworkable, until all accept your well made point that a United Ireland is a lifetime away, if there was a desire for it. I do not like to refer to religious divides etc, you certainly, as you are obviously well aware, don't have to be Protestant, to be a Unionist, or indeed a Catholic to be a Nationalist. The problem we have is that no Nationalist / Republican Party, will tell their people that a United Ireland is an unlikely prospect in their lifetime That in itself generates mistrust, in the Unionist community, which is exploited by many in the DUP etc. Until all can convince people, with sincerity, that they are working for a better NI, for all, with no underlying actions to destroy it's very existence, then we will not achieve, what, Mike Nesbitt was looking for. He was naive, in the extreme, to attempt it at this time. He took the lead, and got scant support, from his intended partner in coalition, so he was doomed to failure, and achieved nothing more than strengthening the position of Nationalists and weakening Unionism, which will make devolved decisions for the betterment of all in NI, difficult if not impossible. Sinn Fein will accelerate their agenda of eroding anything British, deepening divide which suits them, whilst Unionists continue to bicker, divide and conquer, is a tactic they are using to their advantage.""",338,0,0.0

Imagine my surprise, my confusion, my anger when yesterday when I went looking for her feedback I find that every single comment I had ever made on the DUP facebook was removed and I was not longer permitted to comment on their page!!!!!

In many ways, I wish Northern Ireland had never been created, as Home Rule may not have been so bad (but then there was the dominance of the Catholic Church in Ireland as a whole and then the calls to arms by both ""sides"" in 1912, and then the 1916 rebellion, made the messy compromise of Northern Ireland and an Irish Free State inevitable). I\'ve just been watching Spotlight on BBC One NI, about power-sharing here and elsewhere, or lack of it. What a wasted opportunity 1974 was: Brian Faulkner, Gerry Fitt, Oliver Napier & Co, undermined by ""the Demon Doctor"" as Faulkner called him, continuing (mainly) IRA violence, and a weak British Government. 1998 is not quite wasted yet, but, on Spotlight, Bertyie Ahern admitted himself that they spent so much time talking to Sinn Fein, thus undermining the SDLP, because it was SF who had influence over the guns. David Trimble was already being undermined by continual sniping by Paisley, who only ever wanted to be top-dog, over refusal of the IRA to disarm and for republican support of the police. So we are where we are, and the two governments at the time, which had strong mandates & no excuse for weakness, must share a lot of the blame for elevating extremes, because they magnified their importance. The Union? Well, with Brexit in the mix, it\'s clearly made things messy, but, again, we are where where are. The Good Friday is in-tact. The principle of consent is in-tact. If the Union is unsafe, it is not Northern Ireland (or Irish nationalists) that are making it unsafe, it is Brexit, UKIP and possibly the SNP. I am content to have ever greater relationships between North and South and within and between these islands, Relationships build, stalemate splits and stagnates.

I\'m going to give sufficient credit to you to assume that the story of Sodom and Gomorroah doesn\'t influence your viewpoint, particularly as both Ezekiel and Jesus himself clarify that the real reason for their destruction stemmed from social injustice and a lack of hospitality and the ""perversions"" described in Jude 1:7 is clearly a reference to the ill intent towards the angels. I\'ll stick with the NIV for the sake avoiding ambiguity considering there are literally hundreds of English translations of these verses and many of them bear littles resemblence to each other. Gensis 2:24 - That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh. This one is interesting because Eve was created to be, as God described, a ""helper"" to Adam. Interestingly she was also only created after God and Adam considered whether any of the beasts could also be ""helpers"" instead. That\'s pretty disconcerting? Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13 are both fairly clear in what the forbid in the NIV, so I can understand your viewpoint based on these verses. It is unfortunate that you seem to have such callous disregard for Leviticus 19:19 then. I mean, I don\'t know you personally but I can see at least two breaches of what it says in that verse in your profile picture alone. Is this a less important verse? Why is this particular portion of God\'s law less significant in your eyes? I\'m not even going to bother with a deconstrutcion of the story of David and Johnathan in 1 and 2 Samuel as I\'m sure you will tell me that ""Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women"" was some form of poetic license and David didn\'t *really* mean that. Anyway, I digress. I am curious why your main political motivation - having seen your postings here and elsewhere - appears to be the opposition of ""Marriage Equality"" when the party you are choosing to endorse to further that goal are such fat-eating (Lev 3:17), blind-eye-turning (Lev 5:1), unclean-animal-touching (Lev 5:2), neighbour deceiving (Lev 6:2), rabbit-eating(Lev 11:4-7, Lev 11:10-12), football-playing (Lev 11:8), mixed-fabric-wearing (Lev 19:19), beard-grooming (Lev 19:27), tattoo-having (Lev 19:28), foreigner-disrespecting (Lev 19:33-34), land-selling (Lev 25:23), lying (Lev 19:11), stealing (Lev 19:11) hypocrites.

CONSIDING MILLMOUNT DEVELOPMENTS LLP ARE PAYING TO MILLION TO MUCH FOR THIS SITE.... THE RT. HON. PETER ROBINSON KNOWS THE ANSWER.

The Taggarts were poster boys of the property boom, their companies having a turnover of just 20 years after Michael Taggart bought his first plot of land. Their lavish lifestyle inspired many rumours, the juiciest (and most denied) that Lionel Richie played at Michael\'s wedding in 2007. Their businesses collapsed in the crash in 2008 when values plummeted most dramatically and three years later, a site of 96 acres which Taggarts bought with Anglo Irish Bank finance, is on Nama\'s books. But instead of being for sale, accountants in Dublin are looking for \'expressions of interest\' about the Millmount site in Dundonald. It was valued at the peak of the housing market at around per acre but it\'s estimated the current value would be no more than in total. A DoE spokesman confirmed the application was still being considered. Michael Rodgers of Rodgers and Browne Estate Agents in Holywood, Co Down, said it was surprising that the Millmount site was not being explicitly marketed for sale.
