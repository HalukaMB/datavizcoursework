It does depend on your constituency, if yours is a safe seat for any politician then a vote for the greens if you see fit makes sense, as it won't let one or the other in. The main problem we have with British politics is FPTP voting system that pits voters to vote tactically and not for what they want in fear of letting their least liked candidate win. A vote for green can put pressure on other candidates to adopt stances such as vote reform and environmental protections. In a swing seat this is compounded as the other parties will pander for your vote more and are more likely to change a their stances that would enable changes for the better. Of course this is all optimistic as we all know politicians have a habbit of saying one thing and doing the opposite. Which is why the greens are different, because the green party is about green politics, people power and true grassroots movements which make it easy to ensure green candidates are held to account which is only for reassurance mind you as a green candidate would themselves be fearce advocates for what they believe in, which is usually putting people and planet first.

On Syria, not a single panelist had the courage to question what Assad's motive could possibly be - on the eve of burgeoning peace talks - for a chemical weapons attack of this sort. No, the line was, he's a monster and we hate monsters. He done it - despite a lack of clear evidence, green lighting cruise missile attacks by the US now and a dangerous ramping up of global tension. Did anyone ask whether the attack could have been set up by Isis, Al Qaeda, or by factions within Assad's military, a hit on terrorist chemical weapons cache, or a false flag operation involving say the CIA (whose record speaks volumes)? Did any panelist mention Mosul and how this covers up the death of civilians probably in the thousands there over recent months, which instead of being portrayed as heinous crime is presented as a delicate military operation? On Livingstone there was one clear baying crowd truthspeak, a philosophically convoluted and ultimately untenable line of fear (Abbott at least understood that Livingstone would likely win in court), that Livingstone who has spent his life fighting racism at its core has the temerity to challenge the racist power of zionist ideology and the evil apartheid prison state of Israel, which has been in breech of the UN over decades including illegally possessing nuclear weapons. Being Jewish doesn't give you the right to speak for all Jews. There are many Israeli's and Jews across the world who are deeply critical of zionist ideology and the Israeli state and are also aware of the complexities of pre WWII deal with wealthy zionists in Germany (who arguably had the opportunity to help Jews in Germany under Hitler, but chose not to). Livingstone has always been extremely careful not to conflate being Jewish with zionism (it may soon become a crime not to - understand the implications of the US December 2016 Anti-semitism Awareness Act), but has not been afraid to confront the inhumane Israeli State.

If a widget seller gets sick of being taxed and quits the industry, then his competitors will make and sell more, to fill the excess demand, brining the market back in to equilibrium.

"""Kevin Billups - read the idea before being so sure you understand the implications. No one is proposing forcing this on employers. If anything it would be higher paid employees this would happen to at first. Again - optional. There are plenty of sectors of high skill economy where it's completely feasible. Any business that is making as low as 20% value on employee working hours is probably a poor business to begin with, or a new, not very established business. It depends on the sector, but high paid workers produce much more value to the business then they are paid, as do low paid employees. How many coffees does a Costa barista need to make to pay for their hourly average wage? Not very many. Which is why there's a Costa in every town in the country - they add much more value than they cost. All businesses should earn more value from every employee than they provide. That's just a profitable expanding business. The question is where that value goes. If you are building a startup business and are giving yourself low wages, that doesn't mean no value is being created, it means the value is invested back into the business for future higher returns. If you can afford to take on an employee, and you are paying them poor wages, then any value they are creating is again being used as value to help the business grow. Paying poor wages is a choice, not a necessity. If you are paying your employees a salary below their market rate, then they are giving you charity - it's that simple. That charity may be fine with both them and you, but don't pretend it's inevitable. If it IS required then your business has much bigger problems than wages.""",299,0,0.0

I\'ve mentioned it on another post here, but I\'ve worked two offices in the last few years, In the first, I was contracted 37.5 hours a week but was expected to work as many as it took to get the job done (in practice, with their godawful systems and terrible way of treating staff, it took an average of 52.5 a week). In my current office, I\'m contracted to work 35 hours, and until recently, when we went from being a UK head office to the head office for Europe, Israel and the West Bank, I generally worked 34-35 hours a week. Now that we\'re in the transition for the whole Europe thing, I\'ve been working 50 hours a week to try to get my team integrated and up to speed as the stuff I\'m inheriting ran on a very different logic to what I do and wasn\'t administered very well. But I\'m treated well, trusted, motivated, rewarded for my work (from the big stuff like pay rises/bonuses to the small stuff like my name being called out in meetings for excellent customer support or even something as simple as my manager going ""you\'ve been working 8-7 all week, its Friday, I don\'t want you here past 3 today""). All told, I\'d rather work a 70 hour week where I am now than a 5 minute week in the old place.'",394,0,0.0
"'Owen Bennett If you\'re quoting the study I saw, it actually showed that someone who was at work 7 hours a day, but took an hour worth of short breaks would still accomplish as much. Cutting out a whole day would have a rather different effect. As to sick days, in my experience, just treating your staff better cuts those down. To reference the two offices I mentioned above, in the crap one, I didn\'t have to be feeling particularly bad to take a day off, because they way they were treating me meant that I didn\'t want to be there (that office was my first accounting job and when I left, I honestly thought ""is that what work\'s like, why the hell would I want to do that every day?""). With my current job, I\'m working comparable hours now, but the only way I take a day off is if I don\'t feel I can drive there safely. If I can, I\'ll go in even if I end up having to come home later because I *want* to be there. I\'m doing a comparable role, I\'m working comparable hours, but one was exhausting, the other is challenging me. Like I said, I\'d rather work 70+ hours a week where I am than 5 minutes in that first office. The biggest difference - the culture of the offices. The first one was very blame oriented. If you couldn\'t get the work done in time, it was your fault (even if it was a server crash or a total blackout). There was no consideration that there weren\'t enough resources or that the process was flawed, it was your fault. New office, if I go ""I couldn\'t get it done"", then we look at why. We might rearrange a process, a priority list or look to see if we need more resources (doesn\'t necessarily mean I can just go ""I need another person"" and get it, but it would get seriously considered).'",330,0,0.0

"'To answer your question, I was addressing this: ""I would like to see the Greens become more than a 1 MP/1 Lord party, this kind of thing will always hurt that"" the implication here sounding as if this is a typical green kind of thing, but it wasn\'t the sum of my entire point so to focus on it specifically would be cherry picking. Also, to address your claim that I cited the article to back up that everywhere else is doing it, that is a false statement. As I said in my previous post, my statement was that it wasn\'t a new, revolutionary or Green idea. By providing an article which itself is from 2013 and within provides previous examples of this issue arising (such as 2008) in myriad countries from myriad groups, I made a basis for it not being new, revolutionary, or Green. The only other thing I stated was that other countries ""work shorter weeks"" which you may want to note is not the same as ""longer weekends,"" this is a factual statement based on the amount of hours some countries work compared to others, which also adds weight to the fact that it\'s not revolutionary or new. Actually, in places like the US, working hours used to be even longer but have declined from times like the Civil War. Between 1913 and 1919 weekly hours fell by about 8% and in 1926 Henry Ford standardised the five-day workweek, instead of the previous and common six days. This suggests that there might be a natural shift towards shorter working hours, and it will especially come into play more and more in the modern world as automation increases. What I did was make a simple statement and then provide the basis for it in order to generate further discussion. What you did was react in a knee-jerk fashion to go immediately on the attack, perhaps because someone else had put you on the back foot but this isn\'t a helpful response. I suggest if you want further reading on why some people advocate for even shorter hours now that you read things like the stuff below. Again, you do not have to agree with everything within and I\'m sure you will have arguments for the points they raise, but it helps to expand one\'s knowledge rather than tearing everything down as soon as it comes up because it\'s not your already accepted view. \'21 hours - Why a shorter working week can help us all to flourish in the 21st century:\' https://web.archive.org/web/20160209144546/http://b.3cdn.net/nefoundation/f49406d81b9ed9c977_p1m6ibgje.pdf [New Economics Foundation] \'Reduced Work Hours As a Means of Slowing Climate Change:\' http://cepr.net/documents/publications/climate-change-workshare-2013-02.pdf [Center for Economic and Policy Research]'",445,0,0.0

For me, I work in Accounts Receivable for a major franchisor. I have to build long term relationships with our franchisees and there\'s a lot of historic knowledge about how different people\'s accounts are handled, ongoing agreements/queries/etc. Right now I\'m in the middle of a twofold demonstration of how important historic knowledge is for my work. The first is that I\'ve been promoted up to team leader and I\'m training a new clerk while we recruit for the 2nd new clerk and while I can hand across a lot of my processes quite easily, handing across the historic knowledge so that she can build her own relationships with the franchisees. At the same time, I was handed Europe rather abruptly (we were supposed to hand over from Feb to the end of May when the Paris office would close, in practice, that got massively accelerated, so we went to Paris on 13th Feb and back on the 14th, with the staff there only in the office until the 28th). The biggest problem I\'m running into is that the European franchisees come to us and say ""I\'ve got an agreement that I won\'t be charged X"" or ""I\'ve got agreed payment terms of Y instead of your normal Z"". I don\'t have that historic knowledge so I\'m constantly having to say ""can you send me a copy of the agreement or emails where you got that?"", which is tedious for me and incredibly annoying for them.

There may be many people with similar workloads and responsibilities around you, because that's the environment you work in, but overall you are in a very small minority.

There is no such thing as a functioning (pre-automation) economy that has more people in upper management positions than shop floor and manual labour ones. Until drones go widespread and we actually end up fully abolishing a substantial portion of all jobs (which I think is probably still a few years off), Tesco for example will always need significantly more shop floor staff and store managers than they will need accountants and tech support guys.

I respect the fact that you do a job very few other people are able to, and which is close to impossible to hire someone else to do in tandem with you, but I feel a 4-day working week is both helpful and possible to millions of other people, even if you (sadly) don't count among them.""",382,0,0.0

Range Rover Sport produces 1500 T, which is 375 T per wheel in 4x4 or 750 T per wheel in 0x2. 2x750 = 1500, 4x375 = 1500. 1500 = 1500. It\'s the same number. Arguably, since this torque is applied over the road contact area 4x4 drive provides LESS wear on the road surface since it\'s the same force divided over a greater area.

"""Our new Secretary of Dis-Education has big big plans. Pass it on so that everyone you know knows SOON.... Dismal, dismal news for public education..... The school voucher system proposed by Education secretary Betsy DeVos does not mean you can choose any school you want your kid to go to. It means the public education program will be dismantled. If your child has an IEP (individual education plan for students with special needs), kiss it goodbye. If you have a job in special-education, if you're a special education teacher, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech pathologist, a para, a teacher's aid, or an ESL (English as a second language) teacher, you'll go first. House Bill 610 makes some large changes. Inform yourselves. This bill will effectively start the school voucher system to be used by children ages 5-17 and starts the defunding process of public schools. The bill will eliminate the Elementary and Education Act of 1965, which is the nation's educational law that provides equal opportunity in education. ESSA is a big comprehensive program that covers programs for struggling learners, advanced and gifted kids in AP classes, ESL classes, classes for minorities such as Native Americans, Rural Education, Education for the Homeless, School Safety (Gun-Free schools), Monitoring and Compliance, and Federal Accountability Programs. The Bill also abolishes the Nutritional Act of 2012 (No Hungry Kids Act) which provides nutritional standards in school breakfast and lunch. The bill has no wording whatsoever protecting Special Needs kids, no mention of IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), and FAPE (Free Appropriate Public Education). Some things ESSA does for Children with Disabilities: -Ensures access to the general education curriculum. -Ensures access to accommodations on assessments. -Ensures concepts of Universal Design for Learning. -Includes provisions that require local education agencies to provide evidence-based interventions in schools with consistently underperforming subgroups. -Requires states in Title I plans to address how they will improve conditions for learning including reducing incidents of bullying and harassment in schools, overuse of discipline practices and reduce the use of aversive behavioral interventions (such as restraints and seclusion).

I\'ve two hypotheses for this conclusion. 1. Acts of terrorism are carried out to gain political leverage. For Islamic terrorism this is to force changes to laws here to more closely resemble that extreme religious way of life, as far as I can tell*. For far-right terrorism it is concerned with closing the borders and removing non-whites from England\'s shores. If a terrorist act results in mass public fear, that causes more political leverage. Politicians won\'t negotiate with terrorists, but they will listen to worried voters. 2. Backlash against extremist acts results in an us v them mentality. This makes further retaliations on both sides much more likely. *notice my use of the words extremist and terrorist. The vast majority of atrocities carried out recently have carried no discernible political message. They aren\'t coordinated acts of terrorism with a goal, but lone wolf or splinter cell attacks carried out to purely to hurt - for ""revenge"" I\'d guess. I\'d classify them as backlash attacks rather than political terrorism. The only way these will reduce is if the sort of people who are likely to commit these acts feel less threatened - and the more air-time we give to the likes of Paul Nuttall, Nigel Farage and Katie ""drown the Syrian toddlers"" Hopkins, the less likely that is to happen.'",282,0,0.0

When it's used to make people buy things, it's called advertising. But when pundits or organisations, in the full knowledge of this, make public inflammatory remarks designed to trigger unknown potentially-violent people into violent action, it is terrorism. We know (and if you can't see it after the last few years of news then I can't persuade you of anything) that some proportion of people, generally vulnerable, disturbed people, will respond. So when ISIS make a video calling for lone wolf attacks, this is stochastic terrorism. They KNOW that these videos will result in some number of people being triggered into violence. And in just the same way, the BNP, Britain First, Katie Hopkins etc. KNOW that as a result of their vicious, inflammatory and dehumanising bile, some number of people will be triggered into violence - racist attacks, killings etc. Thomas Mair was one such.
