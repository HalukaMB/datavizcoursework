The fact remains that it does not matter why you voted the way you did. It does not matter one bit. You could argue inadequacy and lack of knowledge on both sides. You could argue that whichever side is against you is wrong. Again, it does not matter. What matters here is where we are heading. I am sick to my teeth of hearing this government stirring emotions on poor people, those who are very vulnerable of being manipulated. I am sick of how they still are peddling untruths like the one referenced in the first comment on this thread: The EU is to blame for everything that has gone wrong in your life! Labourers are not poorer because we are in the EU, they are poorer because in an economic model based on financial services and driven by consumerism you need to keep all investment and subsidies in the enterprise that is making you money. Have you ever wondered why is cheaper to bring apples from Africa than it is to grow them here? I believe you immediately are going to blame some obscure idea that has come from the EU, however many other countries IN the EU manage just great to grow their own produce. We don't. The government has taken every subsidy and investment and infrastructure project and has placed it on the service industry, basically the financial services to keep them competitive, and everyone can buy our main exporting 'product'. They've not done so with other industries and no one in this country has said anything at all for many years, as we all have enjoyed the benefits of this booming economic success! We have always had sovereignty, we've always have had border control, even more so than any other EU member states, but the government is quite happy not only to allow people to believe, but to fuel this belief that the EU is responsible for all your woes and worries. The problem I see is not leaving the EU, but leaving the single market and the ECC, both of which are crucial to sustain the industry that has supported the economic model of the UK. Have you recently read on how we 'may have to' accept migration isn't going to go down for a long while? And that we 'may have to accept' that we will have to pay a lot of money to keep the parts we want? None of the issues that fueled many people to vote leave are going to be resolved, but the government has seen a great opportunity to 'white-wash' all their wrongs to strengthen their political position.

Representative democracy is where everyone no matter their beliefs are given a chance to voice their concerns. It isn't ignoring them, we are simply showing how disasterous brexit really is and a disaster as I said before will be felt for generations to come. Unfortunately, it will once again hit the poor working class people (which many voted for brexit, but also many voted to remain). Also by the same argument, we shouldn't hold another general election, as the public voted for a majority Conservative government, it was narrow, but like you say, a majority is a majority. That's what people voted for in 2015, does that mean that people who are Labour supporters, Lib Dem supporters etc. Should just stand down and we stay with this majority Conservative government? A second referendum would be the right way to go I agree as we can't shove the decision aside, as that does undermine democracy. But, it shouldn't stop us to campaign to stop brexit as we can put that on the ballot paper if a second referendum comes around, but currently the only ones fighting for a second referendum are the Lib Dems, why Labour isn't fighting for a referendum on the terms of exit is probably because Jeremy Corbyn voted out in the 1975 referendum.

"""The reason it was a lie was the Leave campaign claimed was the weekly cost of membership and leaving would free up this amount to be spent elsewhere - knowingly misleading the pubic by grossly exaggerating the cost of membership and the money that might be 'saved' by exiting. The gross contribution is never paid due to the rebate (the money never crosses the exchanges), then a substantial amount of the net balance comes back to the UK for spending which the Leave camp have committed to maintaining. The claim was essentially a gamble that the public in general (such as yourself) would believe it to be a fair representation of the cost to the taxpayer, and the counter arguments over the costs made by remainers (such as me) would keep the focus of the debate on the economic cost to the taxpayer, rather than the much wider economic benefits (jobs, growth, wages, prices etc).

We see the stories of people playing the system (huge, HUGE minority) and think we need to cut the supply however it's just not normally the case. People should not have more kids in order to benefit financially, that has to be stopped but before we rip out the welfare, safeguards must be in place. It isn't as big of an issue as we see it due to most of the money goes on food and drink and straight back into the economy, (what is cash other than a loan anyway) so we have the ability to hold back until a complete plan is in place in order to safeguard against changes of circumstance and possibly, the chance for those who knowingly have more kids whilst not being financially prepared, being given food tokens instead of cash, as the main issue here is the hatred of the poor using social monies to pay for sky and fags (and rightly so too). NO child should be left to go hungry whether it's due to parents ignorance or a tragic change in circumstances. Maybe there could be a government based insurance system that whilst we are in a financial position to pay into we can pay for loss of income insurance based on having children?

"""POST-BREXIT WILL BE A DREAMLIKE TRANSITION TO SOLO and for the real reason we are leaving the EU please read to the end......Russia alone needs ringing by NATO THE RELEVANT LABOUR PARTY FUTURE according to Blair is not to descend into Brexit bickering but to barter a future lead on the new idea at the fore of new political thinking in the post-Brexit era before us. Rejecting the far Left himself when in office he led a first-timer centre right-wing Labour as a magnate to all those who admired the Tories but could not give that party their vote. He won over the middle classes, and many wealthy bosses as well as drawing the voting working class towards Labour. He had the people with him because he offered them something tangible that improved their lives. If Brexit uses the same method it will be a political success and Britain will have emulated his triumph. Onwards and upwards, vote centre, with one foot in the Labour camp and one foot in the Tory camp until we see which foot has the best leg to stand on. Now Jeremy Corbyn has to be far further Left than Blair as it is more in his own nature to be so. And Labour's true modern appeal to a restless and as yet undiscerning voting public of the poor majority. Transferring his personal preferences from self to party is proving a rocky road that many Labour voters think reflects his dereliction of duty in policies that fall short of true conviction, though on the contrary, this can be fairly assumed to be an over-pessimistic view of his political stance always made in good faith. JC's policies also show he has remarkable humanity. Like Blair, JC has said he will house the homeless. But the Police think they rely on making a man homeless to control crime; rapists cannot be brought indoors, or lunatic violent men. And there are too many of them to strictly police when accommodation always means another police call. Blair was simply told 'no' he couldn't bring them in. But a 'ban the bomb' PM would only make the enemy attack as they would know he is mad in an atomic age when terrorists are waiting to break down peace at any cost. And Labour is in the wings claiming it is using its time before the next election to formulate new policies it will present then, for post-Brexit is a wobbly uncertain future yet to be defined and attempted in no vain hope that the Tories will succeed. The British are no fool when it comes to winning through adversity with tenacity, hope, courage and national pride well in place. Labour can only be the running mate in the wings until we see exactly what it is we are dealing with, including our divorce from the EU which appears to produce more than one tactical error in its wake. Labour is playing the waiting game, but is it enhancing JC or is it denying him Labour's true image with a Leader who can in the future lead a new Britain? Blair was always new. Blair's New Labour of old now becomes Renewing Labour with its safe new Britain in a brave new world calling upon some of its old political strengths to garner for this new era. And some of JC's he can reveal to us in his own timely manner. JC can make a marriage between what we have already and where it is going to take us now. Post-Brexit will be his newborn baby and he has to show he can Father our nation. Whilst good old Theresa May is proving she is Mother Nature herself in her PM-ship she has turned into a natural role for a politician adaptable and with true genius; hers is a flawless and uncompromising rivalry as she rises to every challenge astute and aware of difficulties arising she deals with so sublimely. It is going to be a dream-like transition from EU to our going it alone and May will make many new friends for Britain to create our new economy. We can be confident of our Tory post-Brexit, a challenge JC can rise to, but can he climb over and above for Labour? The future will tell. Tony has told Jeremy 'make policy' to reflect Labour's values; Tony was great. Theresa is a natural politician who will make the transition easy. Goodbye EU. When it's war in Europe,we hope you can get your money out to fight each other, for Germany is their forced unwilling puppet on Russia's side and she will drag Poland and the Czech Republic in with her.

Any repealing will come at a later date and will be debated and actioned by Parliament. The purpose of the \'repeal bill\' is to incorporate all EU law currently applicable in this country onto the UK domestic statute books, to avoid us dropping off a legal cliff edge the second we leave the EU. This necessitates a number of technical changes in order for the laws to continue to work, e.g. change ""[name of EU regulator]"" to ""[name of UK regulator]"". At a later date Parliament will then be able to debate which converted laws to keep, amend or repeal. I would direct you to the Government\'s White Paper on the repeal bill, which provides three case studies for the type of necessary technical changes to be addressed by secondary legislation under the bill: 1) references to EU law (which will obviously have to be amended as we will no longer be subject to EU law); 2) references to EU institutions (which I have already mentioned); and 3) references to information sharing with the EU institutions (which may have to be tweaked).

For all this talk I\'ve seen about Henry VIII clauses this really isn\'t reflected at all in the Government White Paper itself, which is all we currently have to go on - it\'s all speculation. The most relevant extract of the White Paper is this one: ""Crucially, we will ensure that the power will not be available where Government wishes to make a policy change which is not designed to deal with deficiencies in preserved EU derived law arising out of our exit from the EU"". While I am not for a second advocating trusting politicians, I do think politically speaking it is unlikely in the extreme that the Government will propose limiting Parliament\'s role for all but mechanical changes of the kind I describe above.

"""Just to clarify i am a she not a he but let's run with the thread anyway. Yet more ad hominem attacks and not one iota of explanation as to how we resolve the concerns of remain voters. Ps. Kieren Jameson asking someone if they know something doesn't make it fact. Virtually everything you said about the EU is simply propaganda for the leave vote and the exact opposite of fact ie. A lie. Youth unemployment is not a reason to abandon an institution . The failure of successive uk governments to invest in increased housing and more innovative housing is not anything to do with the EU. I couldn't care less about how many brits abroad vs EU migrants here. I would be quite happy to see the number double because there is nothing inherently disadvantageous about immigration or eu migrants. You may think 70% favour reduced immigration - that's fine, opinion polls are flawed especially if you get them from our right wing press which no doubt you do. It doesn't mean that the reasoning for reducing immigration is sound. Sick of hearing that 'people want reduced immigration' - people want capital punishment (or most opinion polls suggest they would support it and didn't want it abolished). That's why we have governments and civil servants who can rise above populism and racism and other negative 'isms' and create the right (morally speaking) policy. Oh and it's economically sound policy too because immigrants are a net benefit to the public purse (I'm not sure about EU immigrants specifically this is overall figures but I'm reasonably confident the stats stack up for EU migrants too) I have no idea what your point was about regarding multicultural cities - particularly because I struggle to think of an example of a non multicultural city in the UK but also because that just strikes me as an argument for improved policing, seeing as our vote about the EU was not a rejection of multiculturalism or a vote to end all immigration. God... why do I waste my time bothering to speak to people like Brian Toomey. Making assumptions and ad hominem attacks miles off the point and just being generally insulting. I don't have to explain myself to you but I have now been working for 10 years , throughout my education and quite frankly I don't owe my elders anything (except those from my close family and community) so I really have no idea why how long and how hard I've worked has anything to do with the argument. Oh and of course I didn't enjoy free university, going on the dole during my student years or any of the benefits your generation got. Have you worked for long enough to pay off the debt you owe to my grandfather for his efforts in bomber command during the war? Don't worry, he won't be asking you because he isn't as rude as you! I have plenty of respect for the north, but economic facts demonstrate that the wealth generation is driven in the south and you were the one who began with slagging off the liberal south as if we owe you something and we dont. Plus I believe I argued against the politics of division - we are a whole country and so just because the north want out it doesn't mean they can run roughshod over the concerns of those in the south either. Respect goes both ways and I won't be wasting any on someone like you; whose best response is to call someone like me 'sulky' (and little.... I'm 6ft so you were a way off there too). Oh and a man.

Here is some evidence for that..It has been taken from a official sauce. The EU wanted Turkey to join. We spent millions on them and the EU was going to give a loan to Turkey so they could build transits in Turkey that would of taken jobs from us. The EU has been terrible for our fishing industry It is destroying it and there is nothing we can do about it while we are in the EU. They did not take us seriously when it came to our re negotiation giving us a yellow card option that a certain number of states had to agree to in a short amount of time was terrible. Unemployment was and still is very high in most countries within the EU. We have free trade with the EU but the EU says that we should have a 30% tariff on any goods from outside the EU I disagree with that. We are not aloud to sit on the world trade organisation while we are part of the EU.I think this is wrong. We are not aloud to do any trade deals without the EU`s say so. It is against the rules. They are talking about a EU army in Brussels I think that the EU should just concentrate on trade and nothing else. Why do we have two parliaments in Europe that the MEPS spend millions traveling between and why have MEPS at all when we have elected politicians that could do that job at no extra cost. I believe that is wrong. That in my opinion is diluting our democracy. Why is the EU going to have army if it is about trade only. That is wrong. We should have a fair immigration policy for all not for those who live in Europe only. The EU is good for Germany and France and not many other countries.

Prove me wrong. 2) I work all over Europe and enjoy the freedoms we *may* lose. 3) The only way to have true equality in this world is to remove these arbitrary borders which do nothing but keep disparity intact. You and I did NOTHING to earn the advantages we have, so we have no reason to feel like we have a right to protect any artificial leg up we get. 4) You mentioned the fishing argument. The restrictions are there for the fishing stocks and the environment. The EU do a lot for the environment. We are forced to do more than we would otherwise. That is GOOD in my eyes. 5) Finally, a vote to Leave was supporting an element who are very distasteful. Whether you choose to admit it or not, a big chunk of Leave voters did so for xenophobic and/racist reasons. I know we are not supposed to say that, but it is painfully clear.

That IS democracy Another promise broken.. What May and this vile back door government want is NOT democracy by any definition of the term. You never had lack of it in the EU you know (unless you are very blinkered) like everything else that\'s a lie. 13% of our laws are EU originated so we have democracy over 83%.

"""Full article here - http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/02/brexit-big-lie-uk-could-have-reduced-eu-immigration-by-82-under-eu-rules.html Twelve of the fifteen other older EU member states used this option and adopted temporary immigration controls, but the UK, Ireland and Sweden opened their labour markets directly from 1 May 2004 for nationals of the eight central European countries (EU8) that joined the EU on 1 May 2004. Furthermore, the UK did not introduce controls later in the 7-year transition period, when immigration from these countries sharply increased. Immigration from EU8 accounted for on average 16% of non-British net immigration in 2004-11. Therefore, even when respecting all EU rules, 2004-11 net immigration of non-British citizens to the UK could have been cut by a stunning 82% (71% non-EU minus 5% asylum seekers plus 16% EU8). But UK authorities decided not to do that. I'll admit it's nice to hear someone be honest and admit Brexiters had no plan or idea for the future, but I can't get my head round voting for something like that. The EU isn't perfect, but neither is any government organisation, from my local council upwards.

Given your response, I can only presume that you did not, in fact, watch the video. I also did not give my opinion on the million on the bus. I provided evidence that it was not one of the major contributing factors to how people voted. If the actual figure, which is around was used instead, it most likely still would have had the same impact. You cannot show what BREXIT will bring to any degree of certainty. Economists rare forecast the next quater's growth accurately, let alone the economic outlook in 5, 10, or more years.

And that makes sense since France is NOW one of the most interventionist states of the EU. The second point that needs to be questioned in your argumentation is the fact that people in favour of the EU throughout Europe have different views on what must become Europe. As a french, i can tell you that a lot of persons standing up for the EU do not think that democracy is important (as bespeak Sarkozy's action= the treaty of Lisbonne he adopted in 2009, which some points are the same as would have been the treaty for europe if it were adopted by french people in a referendum in 2005). So, yes the EU is undemocratic, and that's its main problem, but did you firmly stand up for it over the past few years and impose your views? No you didn't.""",226,0,0.0
