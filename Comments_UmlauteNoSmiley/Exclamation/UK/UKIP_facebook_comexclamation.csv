That\'s the thing about an economy, it\'s a bit like a table top supported by several legs. You can take away one of the legs and it\'ll still stand up, like it has for the last 9 months after losing 17% of the value of the GBP... it takes time for that to damage the economy. There are various sectors that change at different speeds. So where are we 9 months in? Well 3 of the four legs holding up our economy are nearly completely broken and we haven\'t even left yet! According to the Office of National Statistics... things don\'t look great out there. Worries that the UK economy is losing steam have been strengthened by news of a housing market slowdown, a drop in industrial output and the weakest performance for a year by the construction industry. Economists on Friday said there was growing evidence that the UK economy slipped down a gear as it entered the new year. Economic indicators point to strains on companies from higher costs as the pound\'s slump makes imported materials and fuels more expensive. Consumers, the main driving force of UK economic growth, are also under pressure from rising inflation, with signs they are becoming less willing to spend in shops, restaurants and bars. ""A key component of the slowdown just announced from the ONS has been relatively weak retail sales in the first two months of this year. Consumption is expected to moderate further this year as increasing inflation erodes households\' purchasing power,"" But exports will be brilliant said the Brexiteers because they are cheaper with a devalued currency and yet the trade gap widened in the last quarter because we import more than we export and it is all more expensive for the UK to buy anything from anywhere in the world. So back to those legs under the table... Industrial Production Down. Construction Down. Retail Down. Manufacturing output Down. Currency Down. Housing Down. Job creation Down. Interest rates Down. Wages Down .... just because inflation is going UP this is not a good thing! But hey, I\'m just ""talking the country down aren\'t I?"" .... if that is the case then why don\'t Brexiteers just talk it back up again?

"'"" Minister of State for International Development, Sir Desmond Swayne, said: We have to tackle the causes of poverty and injustice, because if we do not deal with those problems at source, we know where they are going: to our doorsteps and our shores. Aid is undoubtedly in our national interest.Overseas aid is also undoubtedly controversial; it has to be. If I am spending British taxpayers\' money on helping the people of Bangladesh who live on the chars to deal with climate change and flooding, it is clearly not available to deal with flood defences in Durham, York or elsewhere. However, I put it this way: we have pledged to spend 0.7% of our national income on international development, which means that we have 99.3% to spend on ourselves. I do not know anyone who spends 99.3% of their income on themselves; I am not sure I want to know such a person, and I am not so sure that they would have any friends. That is equally true of a nation. What influence would we have in the world, and how could we carry our heads high, if that were the case, and we were to abandon this important pledge? It is important to focus what we spend, rigorously demanding value for money, and ensuring that we have the systems to secure that and to drive down costs, so that we get proper value. [ ] The reality is that over the past five years, we have delivered education for 11 million schoolchildren; 69 million people have received financial assistance and services to trade their way out of poverty; 29 million people have benefited from our nutrition programmes; 5 million people, as my hon. Friend the Member for St Austell and Newquay (Steve Double) said, have benefited from having healthcare professionals attend at birth; 63 million people have had access to clean water; 15 million people have been able to cope with climate change; 44 million children have been immunised; and we have delivered emergency care to 13 million people in the wake of 33 disasters.

"'""Boxed into a corner The most dangerous of Mrs May\'s illusions has been her claim that no deal is better than a bad deal. Her letter this week steps back from this notion, but only a pace. To revert to trading with the EU only on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms would cause serious harm to Britain\'s economy. It would mean the EU imposing tariffs plus a full panoply of non-tariff barriers on almost half Britain\'s exports. No big country trades with the EU only on WTO terms. An acrimonious break-up would make it harder to co-operate in such areas as foreign policy and defence. And it would surely increase the risk of Brexit triggering Scotland\'s exit from the United Kingdom. Mrs May needs not merely to soften her tone, as she has started to do this week, but to lower expectations. Instead of threatening to undercut her European partners by building an unregulated Singapore-on-Thames (something that, despite its appeal to free-traders, would horrify most Brexit voters), or hinting that Britain might co-operate less fully on security, or claiming that the EU needs Britain more than the other way round, she should accept that in these negotiations she holds the weaker hand. She should hence be more flexible over payments into the EU budget, a subject her letter skates over."" - Economist.'",222,0,0.0

Remember how in their ignorance they delighted in the fact that the economy hadn\'t been destroyed in the first 90 days? That\'s the thing about an economy, it\'s a bit like a table top supported by several legs. You can take away one of the legs and it\'ll still stand up, like it has for the last 9 months after losing 17% of the value of the GBP... it takes time for that to damage the economy. There are various sectors that change at different speeds. So where are we 9 months in? Well 3 of the four legs holding up our economy are nearly completely broken and we haven\'t even left yet! According to the Office of National Statistics... things don\'t look great out there. Worries that the UK economy is losing steam have been strengthened by news of a housing market slowdown, a drop in industrial output and the weakest performance for a year by the construction industry. Economists on Friday said there was growing evidence that the UK economy slipped down a gear as it entered the new year. Economic indicators point to strains on companies from higher costs as the pound\'s slump makes imported materials and fuels more expensive. Consumers, the main driving force of UK economic growth, are also under pressure from rising inflation, with signs they are becoming less willing to spend in shops, restaurants and bars. ""A key component of the slowdown just announced from the ONS has been relatively weak retail sales in the first two months of this year. Consumption is expected to moderate further this year as increasing inflation erodes households\' purchasing power,"" But exports will be brilliant said the Brexiteers because they are cheaper with a devalued currency and yet the trade gap widened in the last quarter because we import more than we export and it is all more expensive for the UK to buy anything from anywhere in the world. So back to those legs under the table... Industrial Production Down. Construction Down. Retail Down. Manufacturing output Down. Currency Down. Housing Down. Job creation Down. Interest rates Down. Wages Down .... just because inflation is going UP this is not a good thing! But hey, I\'m just ""talking the country down aren\'t I?"" .... if that is the case then why don\'t Brexiteers just talk it back up again?

"'The Cyrus Report Wednesday, April 5, 2017 Syrian ""Rebels"" Admit Responsibility for Sarin Gas Attack...It was NOT Assad! Syrian rebels in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta have admitted to Associated Press correspondent Dale Gavlak that they were responsible for last week\'s chemical weapons incident which western powers have blamed on Bashar Al-Assad\'s forces, revealing that the casualties were the result of an accident caused by rebels mishandling chemical weapons provided to them by Saudi Arabia. ""From numerous interviews with doctors, Ghouta residents, rebel fighters and their families .many believe that certain rebels received chemical weapons via the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, and were responsible for carrying out the (deadly) gas attack,"" writes Gavlak. (back up version here). Rebels told Gavlak that they were not properly trained on how to handle the chemical weapons or even told what they were. It appears as though the weapons were initially supposed to be given to the Al-Qaeda offshoot Jabhat al-Nusra. ""We were very curious about these arms. And unfortunately, some of the fighters handled the weapons improperly and set off the explosions,"" one militant named \'J\' told Gavlak. His claims are echoed by another female fighter named \'K\', who told Gavlak, ""They didn\'t tell us what these arms were or how to use them. We didn\'t know they were chemical weapons. We never imagined they were chemical weapons."" Abu Abdel-Moneim, the father of an opposition rebel, also told Gavlak, ""My son came to me two weeks ago asking what I thought the weapons were that he had been asked to carry,"" describing them as having a ""tube-like structure"" while others were like a ""huge gas bottle."" The father names the Saudi militant who provided the weapons as Abu Ayesha. According to Abdel-Moneim, the weapons exploded inside a tunnel, killing 12 rebels. ""More than a dozen rebels interviewed reported that their salaries came from the Saudi government,"" writes Gavlak. If accurate, this story could completely derail the United States\' rush to attack Syria which has been founded on the ""undeniable"" justification that Assad was behind the chemical weapons attack. Dale Gavlak\'s credibility is very impressive. He has been a Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press for two decades and has also worked for National Public Radio (NPR) and written articles for BBC News. The website on which the story originally appeared Mint Press (which is currently down as a result of huge traffic it is attracting to the article) is a legitimate media organization based in Minnesota. The Minnesota Post did a profile on them last year. Saudi Arabia\'s alleged role in providing rebels, whom they have vehemently backed at every turn, with chemical weapons, is no surprise given the revelations earlier this week that the Saudis threatened Russia with terror attacks at next year\'s Winter Olympics in Sochi unless they abandoned support for the Syrian President. ""I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us,"" Prince Bandar allegedly told Vladimir Putin, the Telegraph reports. The Obama administration is set to present its intelligence findings today in an effort prove that Assad\'s forces were behind last week\'s attack, despite American officials admitting to the New York Times that there is no ""smoking gun"" that directly links President Assad to the attack. US intelligence officials also told the Associated Press that the intelligence proving Assad\'s culpability is ""no slam dunk."" As we reported earlier this week, intercepted intelligence revealed that the Syrian Defense Ministry was making ""panicked"" phone calls to Syria\'s chemical weapons department demanding answers in the hours after the attack, suggesting that it was not ordered by Assad\'s forces. UPDATE: Associated Press contacted us to confirm that Dale Gavlak is an AP correspondent, but that her story was not published under the banner of the Associated Press. We didn\'t claim this was the case, we merely pointed to Gavlak\'s credentials to stress that she is a credible source, being not only an AP correspondent, but also having written for PBS, BBC and Salon.com.

They also reported that in 2016 alone, Syrian government forces delivered 12,958 barrel bombs; like Chlorine gas and Sarin nerve agent gas, these bombs are illegal under the Geneva convention.

"""Glad you agree with Mr Corbyn What Labour Stands For: Jeremy Corbyn's 10 pledges The Tory Government is taking Britain backwards and failing to meet the challenges of our time. These ten pledges set out the framework for what Labour will campaign for - and what a Labour government will do. Working Together for Real Change 1. FULL EMPLOYMENT We will create a million good quality jobs across our regions and nations, and guarantee a decent job for all. By investing billion in infrastructure and industry backed up by a publicly-owned National Investment Bank and regional banks we will build a high skilled, high tech, low carbon economy to ensure that no one and no community is left behind. We will invest in the high speed broadband, energy, transport and homes that our country needs and allow good businesses to thrive, and support a new generation of co-operative enterprises. 2. A SECURE HOMES GUARANTEE We will build over a million new homes in five years, with at least half a million council homes, through our public investment strategy. We will end insecurity for private renters by introducing rent controls, secure tenancies and a charter of private tenants' rights, and increase access to affordable home ownership. 3. SECURITY AT WORK We will give people stronger employment rights from day one in a job, end exploitative zero hours contracts and create new sectoral collective bargaining rights. We will strengthen working people's representation at work and the ability of trade unions to organise, so that working people have a real voice at work. And we will put the defence of social and employment rights, as well as action against undercutting of pay and conditions through the exploitation of migrant labour, at the centre of the Brexit negotiations agenda for a new relationship with Europe. 4. A SECURE NHS AND SOCIAL CARE We will end health service privatisation and bring services into a secure, publicly-provided NHS. We will integrate the NHS and social care for older and disabled people, funding dignity across the board, and ensure parity for mental health services. 5. A NATIONAL EDUCATION SERVICE We will build a new National Education Service, open to all throughout their lives. We will ensure there is universal childcare to give all children a good start in life, allowing greater sharing of caring responsibilities and removing barriers to women participating in the labour market. We will bring about the progressive restoration of free education for all; and guarantee quality apprenticeships and adult skills training. 6. ACTION TO SECURE OUR ENVIRONMENT We will act to protect the future of our planet, with social justice at the heart of our environmental policies, and take action to fulfil the Paris climate agreement. We will ensure a fair transition to a low-carbon economy, and drive the expansion of the green industries and jobs of the future, using our National Investment Bank to invest in public and community-owned renewable energy. We will deliver clean energy and curb energy bill rises for households energy for the 60 million, not the Big Six energy companies. We will defend and extend EU environmental protections. Working Together for Real Change 7. PUT THE PUBLIC BACK INTO OUR ECONOMY We will rebuild public services and expand democratic participation, put the public back into our economy, give people a real say in their local communities with increased local and regional democracy. We will act to 'insource' our public and local council services, increase access to leisure, arts and sports across the country, and expand our publicly- controlled bus network. We will bring our railways into public ownership and extend democratic social control over our energy. 8. CUT INEQUALITY IN INCOME AND WEALTH We will build a progressive tax system so that wealth and the highest earners are fairly taxed, and shrink the gap between the highest and lowest paid. We will act to create a more equal society, boost the incomes of the poorest and close the gender pay gap. 9. ACTION TO SECURE AN EQUAL SOCIETY We will ensure that the human rights of all citizens are respected and all are protected from discrimination and prejudice. We will take action to tackle violence against women and girls, racism and discrimination on the basis of faith, and secure real equality for LGBT and disabled people. We will defend the Human Rights Act and guarantee full rights for EU citizens living and working in Britain and not allow them to be used as pawns in Brexit negotiations. 10. PEACE AND JUSTICE AT THE HEART OF FOREIGN POLICY We will put conflict resolution and human rights at the heart of foreign policy, commit to working through the United Nations, end support for aggressive wars of intervention and back effective action to alleviate the refugee crisis. We will build human rights and social justice into trade policy, honour our international treaty obligations on nuclear disarmament and encourage others to do the same.""",822,0,0.0

Like tony blair has with the wars he promoted. (No capitals for tony=no respect) Products break after the guarantee. Unfair contracts and small print. Watch the lightbulb conspiracy where Dutch, German and French corporations form a cartel to make products that fail. Most of our tools now are German? Civil contracts are written in legalese, the secret language of the law society created in 1914. They use blacks law English dictionary to trick us and manipulate us into using their contracts.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Dutch managed to dominate world trade, and they did so through the pioneering use of corporations and finance. However, not all of their ways were new; traditional methods such as violently enforced monopolies, unfair trade agreements, and warfare The reason we need out of Europe is to remove these contracts and manipulation from our country so we can go back to normal. This is why we are in this mess and we need to cut all ties and start again with our contracts. Which is just a format of truth and not a contract of demands. One demand. THE TRUTH!!! No more lies.

"'Rose, Islamic terrorism is derived from belief in propositions about the nature of the universe we live in found within in Islam. Discord in the Middle East can undoubtedbly catalyse violence through the lens of Islamic terrorism, but it isn\'t the only answer. Many Muslims who commit terror offences or hold Islamist views have never been to the Middle East in their lives. Indeed, the most ""hardline"" demographic of Muslims in the west are 18-24 year olds, followed by 24 - 30 years - most of who have never set foot in Asia in their lives. Secondly, yes, the Bible is also violent and the KKK are nutjobs. But that is a separate issue. We\'re talking about Islam here, not Christianity. We can\'t keep comparing everything to the extremely low bar that Christianity sets because a) it\'s pointless and gives a low target to aim for (we can do better) and b) you can\'t have an interesting discussion about problems uniquely pertaining to Islam if somebody is trying to derail the conversation by issuing criticisms of Christianity. I agree that this is also a conversation that needs to be had, but it\'s a separate conversation. You also seem to think that there\'s a West vs Islam/Muslim dichotomy here. Not true. The overwhelming majority of the victims of Islam terrorism and cultural jihad are Muslims themselves. Besides, Western actions in the Middle East haven\'t always been bad. Sometimes they have been severely misguided and have made things worse. But, for example, the people of Iraq had been petitioning the US to save them from the scourge of Saddam Hussein for over 10 years before the Anfal campaign, an assault on the citizens of Iraq with chemical weapons by Hussein, inspired them into action. Again, I never suggested punishing all of them. I never suggested deporting all of them. I didn\'t suggest this for one.

"""POST-BREXIT WILL BE A DREAMLIKE TRANSITION TO SOLO and for the real reason we are leaving the EU please read to the end......Russia alone needs ringing by NATO THE RELEVANT LABOUR PARTY FUTURE according to Blair is not to descend into Brexit bickering but to barter a future lead on the new idea at the fore of new political thinking in the post-Brexit era before us. Rejecting the far Left himself when in office he led a first-timer centre right-wing Labour as a magnate to all those who admired the Tories but could not give that party their vote. He won over the middle classes, and many wealthy bosses as well as drawing the voting working class towards Labour. He had the people with him because he offered them something tangible that improved their lives. If Brexit uses the same method it will be a political success and Britain will have emulated his triumph. Onwards and upwards, vote centre, with one foot in the Labour camp and one foot in the Tory camp until we see which foot has the best leg to stand on. Now Jeremy Corbyn has to be far further Left than Blair as it is more in his own nature to be so. And Labour's true modern appeal to a restless and as yet undiscerning voting public of the poor majority. Transferring his personal preferences from self to party is proving a rocky road that many Labour voters think reflects his dereliction of duty in policies that fall short of true conviction, though on the contrary, this can be fairly assumed to be an over-pessimistic view of his political stance always made in good faith. JC's policies also show he has remarkable humanity. Like Blair, JC has said he will house the homeless. But the Police think they rely on making a man homeless to control crime; rapists cannot be brought indoors, or lunatic violent men. And there are too many of them to strictly police when accommodation always means another police call. Blair was simply told 'no' he couldn't bring them in. But a 'ban the bomb' PM would only make the enemy attack as they would know he is mad in an atomic age when terrorists are waiting to break down peace at any cost. And Labour is in the wings claiming it is using its time before the next election to formulate new policies it will present then, for post-Brexit is a wobbly uncertain future yet to be defined and attempted in no vain hope that the Tories will succeed. The British are no fool when it comes to winning through adversity with tenacity, hope, courage and national pride well in place. Labour can only be the running mate in the wings until we see exactly what it is we are dealing with, including our divorce from the EU which appears to produce more than one tactical error in its wake. Labour is playing the waiting game, but is it enhancing JC or is it denying him Labour's true image with a Leader who can in the future lead a new Britain? Blair was always new. Blair's New Labour of old now becomes Renewing Labour with its safe new Britain in a brave new world calling upon some of its old political strengths to garner for this new era. And some of JC's he can reveal to us in his own timely manner. JC can make a marriage between what we have already and where it is going to take us now. Post-Brexit will be his newborn baby and he has to show he can Father our nation. Whilst good old Theresa May is proving she is Mother Nature herself in her PM-ship she has turned into a natural role for a politician adaptable and with true genius; hers is a flawless and uncompromising rivalry as she rises to every challenge astute and aware of difficulties arising she deals with so sublimely. It is going to be a dream-like transition from EU to our going it alone and May will make many new friends for Britain to create our new economy. We can be confident of our Tory post-Brexit, a challenge JC can rise to, but can he climb over and above for Labour? The future will tell. Tony has told Jeremy 'make policy' to reflect Labour's values; Tony was great. Theresa is a natural politician who will make the transition easy. Goodbye EU. When it's war in Europe,we hope you can get your money out to fight each other, for Germany is their forced unwilling puppet on Russia's side and she will drag Poland and the Czech Republic in with her.

How does the perilous future of oil impact on our thinking about production and transporting of goods? European countries are our closest neighbours - it makes sense in all ways to have good trading relationship with them.
