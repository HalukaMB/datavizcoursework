How do pensions and pensioners come out in your equations Mrs May Does moving the pensionable age to 68 make your government feel proud Bring back some of the foreign aid you keep increasing year on year that would certainly help but I guess foreign aid is more important than British men and women when it comes to the working age It would also be amazing if you could somehow address this to the nation,75,0,0.0
Foreign aid was increased out of sight by The Blair administration And when retirement was set at 60 for woman  65 for men we were living a lot shorter than now,31,0,0.0
You are clearly unaware that successive governments have warned about an increase in the pension age since the 1980s This is because pensions are paid directly from NI contributions and it could be seen that the birth rate was falling and people are living longer It was further exacerbated when Gordon Brown became chancellor and at the stroke of a pen took away the favourable tax status that pension funds enjoyed thus wrecking just about every company pension scheme in the UK Sadly many people ignored the warnings and failed to make any additional provision for retirement  they all jump on the bandwagon and blame the current government which is just nonsense  Where I do agree is that we could make much better use of the millions wasted on foreign aid  this money should be used to benefit British citizens only,141,1,0.0070921985815602835

PAY AS YOU LEARN A large independent survey released to say revals that in England parents in 1 in 6 state schools are being asked to pay their childrens school on a regular basis so that school essentials can continue These essentialsd include textbooks pens pencils art maerials and tickets for such events as plays and concerts These payments are being used to compensate for the huge gaps in funding that many English state schools are having to bear Three out of four teachers reported their schools budget had been significantly cut this year The poll also found that 50 percent of teachers had bigger classes than previous years while many schools were struggling to fill canacies where they could afford the staff A stunning 93 of teachers at state schools in England described themselves as pessimistic about their schools future In the recent budget Philip Hammond sent aside aside for the expansion of governments free school programme with schools free to offer selective education Theresa Mays dream is to restore grammar schools to an eminent position in the English educational systems though these new grammar schools will be highly selective and will take just the cleverest 10 of children While not supporting the reintroduction of grammar schools in Scotland Ruth Davidson the Tory leader has demanded a back to basics review of the school curriculum to give it an emphasis on knowledge and facts Ms Davidson asserts that traditional rote learning  learning facts by heart  will produce better results than a focus on what she calls life skills An independent report from the OECD Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has assessed the Scottish governments Curriculum for Excellence as a bold and a successful reform that was delivering a broadened education experience for young people within Scotland Nicola Sturgeon First Minister of Scotland has made millions available for headteachers throughout Scotland to use in the ways they themselves decide what is most essential for their schools Ms Sturgeon has staked her reputation on making significant improvements in the results obtained by pupils and students at Scottish schools The Sage of Auchtermuchty will periodically report on their progress,358,8,0.0223463687150838

Back in 1973 we were told we were joining a common market What we actually joined was a supranational political union Since that illfated Yes vote we have seen our rights of selfgovernment slowly eroded in the stealth creation of a United States of Europe which has its own flag national anthem parliament central bank court of justice and a vast civil service The EU already holds a huge amount of control over our financial services fishing farming energy and trade It dictates UK business and employment legislation and immigration rules It seeks greater control over our law enforcement services our foreign affairs and tax policy There is significant momentum behind plans for an EUwide army and police force  we only have to read the EUs Five Presidents report to see their ambitions lie in further advancement towards a political superstate In addition to this we send million each week to Brussels for the privilege thats money that could be better spent on our priorities One critical area where we have lost control  immigration  is was at the forefront of a lot of peoples minds as we approach the referendum in June I am in favour of immigration But lets be clear  what most people want is a fair and controlled immigration system one where we have the final say But in the EU we dont EU law demands that the UK has an open door to EU countries which has resulted in a population the size of Newcastle arriving every year It doesnt take a genius to realise that this is unsustainable Not only has this put a great strain on school places and on public services like the NHS it has also forced us to prevent people with muchneeded skills from coming to Britain It means we have to turn away doctors teachers bright feepaying students and entrepreneurs from our friends in the Commonwealth and beyond This is clearly unfair We have lost control of our borders The only way to install a fair and manageable immigration system is to leave the EU single market,347,9,0.025936599423631124

Back in 1973 we were told we were joining a common market What we actually joined was a supranational political union Since that illfated Yes vote we have seen our rights of selfgovernment slowly eroded in the stealth creation of a United States of Europe which has its own flag national anthem parliament central bank court of justice and a vast civil service The EU already holds a huge amount of control over our financial services fishing farming energy and trade It dictates UK business and employment legislation and immigration rules It seeks greater control over our law enforcement services our foreign affairs and tax policy There is significant momentum behind plans for an EUwide army and police force  we only have to read the EUs Five Presidents report to see their ambitions lie in further advancement towards a political superstate In addition to this we send million each week to Brussels for the privilege thats money that could be better spent on our priorities One critical area where we have lost control  immigration  is was at the forefront of a lot of peoples minds as we approach the referendum in June I am in favour of immigration But lets be clear  what most people want is a fair and controlled immigration system one where we have the final say But in the EU we dont EU law demands that the UK has an open door to EU countries which has resulted in a population the size of Newcastle arriving every year It doesnt take a genius to realise that this is unsustainable Not only has this put a great strain on school places and on public services like the NHS it has also forced us to prevent people with muchneeded skills from coming to Britain It means we have to turn away doctors teachers bright feepaying students and entrepreneurs from our friends in the Commonwealth and beyond This is clearly unfair We have lost control of our borders The only way to install a fair and manageable immigration system is to leave the EU single market,347,9,0.025936599423631124

As the Prime Minister signed the letter triggering Article 50 the divorce clause in the EU treaties that provides the only legal route for the UK to withdraw from the EU we reached the end of the beginning For nine months the UK and the EU have been in limbo In the days and weeks following the June 2016 referendum those who advocated leaving the EU were quick to claim that the muchheralded economic disasters threatened by George Osborne and David Cameron in Project Fear had not occurred Unhappy Remainers were equally swift in their rebuttals as proponents of the two camps seemed determined to replay the arguments of their respective referendum campaigns and in some cases the arguments of more than four decades Certainly while the value of sterling might have dropped and inflation begun to rise the economic indicators are far from the nightmare scenarios invoked during the referendum But that scenario was based on the idea that Cameron would trigger Article 50 immediately upon a Leave vote in practice he left the field and his successor delayed the fateful act These last nine months have thus been little more than a phoney war The UK has barely begun to outline its negotiating objectives while the other 27 member states made clear they would not engage in discussions before the UK formally indicated its intention to leave the Union That day has now come The nature of the UKs future relationship with the EU remains unclear although the Prime Ministers construal of the vote to leave the EU as a sign of popular support for curbing immigration has led to one clear red line that the UK will not seek to remain in the single market This decision is perfectly rational and logical if one accepts the Prime Ministers premise regarding the reasons 17 million people voted to leave since free movement of people is a prerequisite of membership of the single market Yet there is good cause to believe Mrs May is misguided in her interpretation there were myriad reasons for the leave votes whether to reclaim sovereignty or reduce payments to the EU all neatly encapsulated in the beguiling phrase take back control For many of those who voted leave immigration and free movement were not the reason to seek EU withdrawal even many Leavers acknowledge the importance of EU nationals to the UK economy To base a decision to leave the single market on the premise that we shall thereby control immigration is only a plausible thesis if those advocating it believe that Leave voters intended to prioritise controlling immigration numbers over the security of the economy our agriculture and our welfare services including the NHS and care of the elderly of which are heavily dependent upon immigrant labour Nonetheless the Prime Minister appears to have adopted an approach that endears her to the hard Brexiteers in her own party allowing a clean break from the EU even if a majority in the country seems to favour a closer ongoing relationship with the 27 For a city such as Cambridge and for the University of Cambridge especially membership of the single market with its associated rights of free movement is selfevidently beneficial Many academics myself included have benefited over the years from EU funding but what is at least as important is the opportunity to collaborate across borders without having to consider whether a visa is needed EU nationals from other countries have played a vital role as students and colleagues Even Brexiteers who wanted to reduce immigration were broadly in favour of guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals who were already in the UK at the time of the referendum Alongside many of us who would have preferred the UK not to be in the EUs departure lounge some of those Leavers have been demanding that the Government should give a unilateral undertaking to EU nationals already in the UK The Government has said such people along with UK nationals resident elsewhere in the EU will be their first priority in the negotiations This is laudable although it fails to comprehend a key facet of EU negotiations nothing is agreed until everything is agreed The campaign to secure the rights of EU nationals will no doubt continue in the hope that some of the uncertainty engendered by the process of Brexit can be minimised though the idea that some issues can be picked off and resolved in tranches is almost certainly fanciful Meanwhile the withdrawal negotiations are likely to take the two years envisaged in the Lisbon Treaty and that will only resolve the divorce settlement For the longer term future arrangements with the 27 further more protracted negotiations are likely Triggering Article 50 is not the end though it would seem to herald the beginning of the end of the UKs membership of the EU,812,10,0.012315270935960592

James Egan All I can say is that there was a very good reason for joining the 6 However that reason has gone and most of us do not want to subsidise 25 out of the 27 Just study the political history from the post war trade union strikes right up to and including the late seventiesin the fifties and sixties there were so many strikes that overseas customers never knew when or if their order would be delivered The value of the pound plummeted because of the continuing rounds of pay rises thought to stop the strikes but actually fuelling more When it had got so bad that the rest of the world stopped buying British we had to join the 6 to have any market at all Since the late seventies the UK has reduced the number of petty strikes and has become much more inline with the values of western countries In order to build from our present position we need to stop the restrictions on all forms of farming and to regrow our almost non existent manufacturing industry At one time 90 of our GDP was from manufactured goods to less than 10 now It is logical and reasonable that the Blue party will be most suitable to lead this as the Reds only want to empty the bank accounts and the others are like the wind changing at a moments notice and promising things that they will never deliver Once there is manufacturing growth it is likely that the north of the country including Scotland will be the areas seeing the most improvements and employment rises Hopefully when this occurs the current Scottish cancer SNP will go back to the little hole in the Lothian district from whence they came So it is onwards and upwards for the UK and the Blue team seem to be the best ones to oversee it Rethink your plan to quit but do read the political history from post WW2 to now as you will soon remember why you have been a blue boylike me Good luck in your research,351,5,0.014245014245014245

Gavin Moat It was Margaret Thatcher who introduced the Right to Buy Scheme The only people who could buy the Council properties were Council tenants many of whom had been paying rent for tenfifteen twenty years Those people could never had afforded to buy their own home and get a foot on the housing ladder without the Right to Buy scheme Those who did buy received a discount on the value of the property based on the amount of years they had been Council tenants House prices rose in later years and many whod taken advantage of the scheme were then able to sell their property and purchase another in an areas of their choosing It served them well and many were happy There will always be moaners Have a nice day,132,2,0.015151515151515152

The cowardly custards of the Conservative party are too terrified of the law and the constitutions of England and Scotland and the Union to risk agreeing any sort of test before the UK automatically ceases to exist in two years time As it stands trying to take Scotland out of the EU is clearly contrary to the will of the people of Scotland and therefore a basic breach of the Treaty of Union and the end of the UK The only way Westminster can legitimise the continuing existence of the UK with Brexit is to hold a referendum in which the will of the people of Scotland is clearly shown to be to Remain in the UK regardless of the EU issue IF May and her Westminster pals are serious about wanting to keep Scotland as part of the UK they need the referendum even more than we do rather than crouching scared in the benches of Westminster crying nonono otherwise on 30 March 2019 its automatically the end of the Union,172,2,0.011627906976744186

Im not rich or well off by any means and I dont agree with everything the conservatives dohowever supporters of every party have to admit their parties have faults But the way I see it now is we are paying for all the nice things we have had for many years And even as a lower earner who does not claim a penny and is a single person paying for a house bills car etc and only just gets by I dont feel like the world owes me a living Of course I agree Care for the elderly and disabled needs to be improved But the biggest problem with our welfare system is it is so easy for people to abuse the system ,123,5,0.04065040650406504
James Lewis What do you suggest that would stop people abusing the system The only tory supporter argument Ive heard so far usually boils down to I think cuts are fine because I dont want my tax money going to people who take advantagewhich frankly is saying a whole lot of nothing So what do you think Most intelligent labour supporters do realise that money doesnt grow on trees and that we cant just spend spend spend we just think the cuts are being made in the worst possible places How anyone cant understand that baffles me to be honest,100,5,0.05
Well in terms of job seekers allowance for the physically able put a time limit on how long you can claim more Encourage people to get into work with tax relief on low earners etc I know as a low earner that my life would probably be a lot easier on the dole but I still work full time because thats the way I am But we need to give people an incentive to get in to work Offer more help and incentives for those who are genuinely trying Make the whole system harder to cheat I personally used to be a labour supporter But I just cant support their credit card habits and it feels to me that they go far to support minorities that they forget about the every day voter I have no problems with offering support and standing up for minorities But Im what I call humanist I believe that everyone should be treated equally It almost seems to me that labour go to such lengths to appeal to the minority voters that they have alienated the every day working manwoman,185,4,0.021621621621621623

As it stands trying to take Scotland out of the EU is clearly contrary to the will of the people of Scotland and therefore a basic breach of the Treaty of Union and the end of the UK The only way Westminster can legitimise the continuing existence of the UK with Brexit is to hold a referendum in which the will of the people of Scotland is clearly shown to be to Remain in the UK regardless of the EU issue IF May and her Westminster pals are serious about wanting to keep Scotland as part of the UK they need the referendum even more than we do otherwise its automatically the end of the Union,116,1,0.008620689655172414
It was a UK vote and as of 2014 Scotland voted to remain as part of that UK Also knowing full well Cameron would call and in out refereundum should the Tories win the 2015 election Which they did therefore it was not a breach of the act of union since the UK voted to leave,56,1,0.017857142857142856
Scots narrowly voted to stay in the UK in 2014 because of a series of statements and promises that turned out to be untrue Because of the Scottish Constitution where the will of the Scottish people holds paramount sovereignty over the monarchy and parliaments as regards Scottish affairs the Scottish Parliament could not legally declare UDI despite a clear SNP majority in the Scottish Parliament If EU membership was just a trading agreement Westminster might have the right to withdraw Scotland form it but as it is much more than that the Scottish Constitution that underpins one end of the Treayy of Union comes into play AS the Scottish people overwhelmingly voted to stay bin the EU trying to take Scotland out of the EU is clearly contrary to the will of the people of Scotland and therefore a basic breach of the Treaty of Union and the end of the UK The only way Westminster can legitimise the continuing existence of the UK with Brexit is to hold a referendum in which the will of the people of Scotland is clearly shown to be to Remain in the UK regardless of the EU issue IF May and her Westminster pals are serious about wanting to keep Scotland as part of the UK they need the referendum even more than we do rather than crouching scared in the benches of Westminster crying nonono otherwise on 30 March 2019 its automatically the end of the Union,245,5,0.02040816326530612

The Prime Minister revealed being a Liberal Democrat  see statemenet in House of Commons about EU Liberal Democratic values This is a Conservative and also responsible for being in charge frighteningly enough of  among other things  Brexit A Conservative MP is supposed to follow Conservative values and a British PM is supposed to be interested in the political nature of the UK not the political nature of the EU May needs to resign from the Party and join the Liberal Democrats this was an absurd statement and also effectively a betrayal of the UK The concern should be negotiations of the Leave process not worrying about EU values This creature is a total idiot and it is inexplicable that May was appointed as leader having been a substantially useless Home Secretary,131,3,0.022900763358778626
And also 200 boxes of Britishmade ammunition and weapons were intercepted en route to the former al Qaeda group in Damascus just over two weeks ago They are now in a new umbrella group Hayat Tahrir al Sham with four allied terror groups ISIS has also been operating against the Syrian Government in the Damascus area The previous week the Government had stated they would continue supporting the Syrian moderate opposition which is of course illegal action anyway but then stated they could not name the moderate opposition groups Which is because the Government has been supporting terrorism for five years in Syria In January last year under Liaison Committee questioning Cameron admitted the 70000 moderate rebels he supported were in reality hardline Islamists In May 2015 a terrorism trial for offences in Syria collapsed in London when the Defence pointed out the Government supports the same groups the Defendant was involved with and it was considered too embarassing for the Government for the trial to continue US Defence Intelligence Report 2012 The Salafist the Muslim Brotherhood and AQI are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria An insurgency our Government and the US fully supported Also in that Report There is a possibility of establishing a Salafist principality in eastern Syria and that is what supporters to the opposition in Syria want to isolate the Syrian regime This is a reference to ISIS the JV team as Obama referred to them Comment I wrote on windbag Johnsons FB yesterday Boris Johnson it is unbelievably shameful that Matthew Rycroft objected to OPCWUN inspectors going into Iraq to investigate chemical weapons use by ISIS And I just caught up with this news so unanimous concern of the UN Security Council about ISIS use of chemical weapons  which they have done extensively in Syria  followed by our Government trying to block investigation of their use of chemical weapons in Iraq How really diabolically shameful I am waiting for a reply to mid January correspondence I wrote to A Rudd which must have been lost after the Home Office received it as they say they didnt but I received an auto acknowledgement And in any case had sent copies to Ms Rudd at her Parliamentary Office on 27th February and received an auto acknowledgement to that as well This concerned the statement on leaked tape by J Kerry at a UN side meeting to the Syrian opposition saying that the US wanted ISIS to remain free to put pressure on President Assad but that Russia was bombing ISIS This was at a time that the US was pretending to lead an international coalition against ISIS Kerry was due to visit here and I was just pointing out he should be barred as a threat to our national security due to his protection of ISIS I had made the same point about Obama last year when he was due to visit he had blocked 75 of US sorties from bombing ISIS in Iraq leaving them free to murder thousands more Iraqis I didnt receive a reply to that email at all The polite little auto response in January stated the Home Office aims to reply to correspondence within 20 days It is now about two and a half months since I received that so I expect a reply from them soon What was the point of writing that here  umm Oh yes I remember our Government disgracefully trying to block investigation into ISIS use of chemical weapons in Iraq I think you should be told to make a statement about that as our Governments stance is so atrocious Like Reply 17 hrs Apologies for the length This was on his Daesh video topic from a couple of days ago,626,22,0.03514376996805112

SAFE IN TORY HANDS Today April 1st  but this is not an April Fools joke Biffo Johnson the blundering buffoon of a Foreign Secretary declared As ever the UK remains implacable and ROCKLIKE in our support for Gibraltar Why is that even when Johnson intends to be serious he sounds silly This reassurance was necessary because Theresa May did mention Gibraltar once in her 2200word letter triggering Article 50 starting the Brexit process Did she even forget to let Girbralter now she was triggering Article 50 in the way she forgot to tell Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland The increasing levels of incompetence in the Tory Brexiteers is not reassuring Are the interests of these minifish an afterthought as the chairman of the House of Lords EU Committee warned Clare Moody Labour MEP for Gibraltar and south west England told BBC Radio Fours Today programme If the government has overlooked the interests of Gibraltar which is a crucial part of the kind of constitutional arrangements of our membership of the European Union then what else are they going to overlook as well Theresa May has certainly declared that she intends to ignore the UKs constitutional arrangements with Scotland by booting the Scottish Parliaments request for a second idy reference if required after the Brexit terms are clear as far and deep into the long grass as she can From beyond the border Scots can still hear Mother Theresa crowing on the Tory dungheap And are these the same thighhigh boots she wore to meet the Queen Is TWOFACED too strong a term Lets ask prison staff in England and Wales Only a few days ago Justice Secretary Liz Truss was strumpeting from the dung heap that prison staff in England and Wales will receive new pay allowances of up to 000 Hurrah But hold on It turns out that only Only 5 of existing prison staff will receive increased allowances while the other 95 will receive You do the maths Only 1617 prison officers out of more than 30742 staff working in publicsector prisons  526 of the workforce  will receive any kind of additional allowance Mother Theresa has assured the nation that the NHS is safe in our hands What else can she assure us is safe in Tory hands,380,17,0.04473684210526316

NO GUNBOAT DIPLOMACY REQUIRED A former Leader of the Conservative Party has stated that Theresa May will show the same support as Maragaret Thatcher did for Falklands Lord Howard  Michael Howard Baron Howard of Lympne  stated on the Andrew Marr Show Thirty five years ago this week Andrew another woman and Prime Minister sent a task force halfway across the world to protect another small group of British people against another Spanishspeaking country And Im absolutely clear that our current woman Prime Minister will show the same resolve in relation to Gibralter as her predecessor Although Mrs May has denied that she is a second Mrs Thatcher Lord Howard who is at the heart of the Brexiteer clearly beleives that she is willing to take whatever steps is necessary to keep Gibralter under the sole authority of the United Kingdom Mrs May has already made it absolutely clear the UK is steadfastly committed to Gibraltar Even if the government of Gibralter were to request negotiations concerning the current constitutional arrangements Mrs May would declare now is not the time exactly as she has done with Scotland While it is inconceivable that one member of the European Union would send a task force against another member of the European Union Lord Howard seems to be suggesting that there would be no such restraints since the United Kingdom triggered Article 50 It is irrelevant that 959 of the voters in Gibralter voted to REMAIN a member of the European Union Labours deputy leader Tom Watson has questioned how senior Tories raising the prospect of war in Europe would help the UKs Brexit negotiations Given that there are more than threequarters of a million Brits living in Spain it would be helpful if Mrs May ruled out any form of gunboat dimplomacy in relation to Spain  or to Scotland,306,15,0.049019607843137254

Could I take this opportunity to humbly make a suggestion I understand the need for cutbacks across all sectors of society which while it being unfortunate will effect societys less fortunate people such as the poor disabled and elderly many of which I am sure Conservative MPs also have amongst their loved ones However as we make these cutbacks we need a cost effective transition It seems only common sense that if the government bodies are going to reduce and close which currently support the members of our society who need support that from the midst of those communities organisations will spring up to take the weight of these closures and cutbacks If this is the case as expected then the cost of reestablishing said organisations would be extremely high and waste a large portion of the funds raised to undertake this new responsibility The transition I propose would be a transition of the already established organisations back to the public sector rather than simply closing down these established services only to have the charity sector then have to open a brand new infrastructure to replace these government run organisations It seems only logical to hand over what is already in place rather than to close one at a high cost and open another in its place at a high cost rather than the administration required to simply pass on the baton In turn it wont alienate the communities around the country who already feel the sense of us vs them and creates a sense of working together for the greater good Your respectfully,264,3,0.011363636363636364

Dan Pollard the point is I do not trust the Spanish why would they want a different deal for Gibraltar Unless they wish to blockade them again So UK mainland needs the same deal so we have same options open like if they blockade Gibraltar we need to put airport tax on to deter people from holidaying in Spain to make Spain think again So we can use trade as pressure on Spain to make them think twice,78,1,0.01282051282051282

sadly today I have cancelled my membership and support of the Conservative Party I have supported the Tories since 1979 but no longer feel that this party matches my values and principles This has not been an easy decision but progressively I have become disenchanted with the current govt and leadership in spite of early high expectations I have believed in the Tory principles of a fairer Britain a country that delivers opportunity for all and rewards hard work and effort I now see a party being dragged ever increasingly to the right by a group of all too powerful back benchers I see a govt that have abandoned the 48 who voted to Remain as we hurtle ever closer to a Hard Brexit I see a chancellor who is impotent even when making small and reasonable fiscal changes On question time I see an arrogance ignorance and breathtaking naivety from David Davis when it comes to negotiations with the EU and yesterday we hear an ex leader and Home Secretary threatening war against out allies and neighbours Luke I really do not recognise this party from the one I voted and campaigned for in 2015 To me it feels that we have not moved to exploit the centre ground vacated by a pathetic Labour party or chaotic Liberal party but instead have replaced UKIP with barmy expectations right wing rhetoric and delivery of a disastrous deal with Europe ie probably no deal to please the likes of Gove Fox Davis Redmond and his gang Currently I see no home for my support and only hope for an early general election to increase the Conservative majority and reduce the power of the back benchers ans make the Tories more balanced and palatable It seems however that May will not go to the country and gain a mandate for her perilous course I only hope over time greater pragmatism openness and compromise will take place to ensure the future for our country and children What we need now is a centrist party that delivers on Brexit in respect of the referendum but also takes into consideration the whole population not least the most vulnerable who will suffer the most from a hard Brexit Failure to do so could lead to a catastrophic exit from the EU followed by a general election win for the labour left I hope that you and other Tories can start to influence the PM but to date many more moderate members appear silenced as to speak against a hard Brexit appears to be undemocratic and virtually treasonable Having knocked many doors during the last election and during the referendum I would imagine a Hard Brexit could be v damaging to the Tories in many parts of the South West as well as S Glos I have no axe to grind with the local MP Luke Hall but am really concerned by this govt and PM who forge ahead without a real mandate,496,16,0.03225806451612903

David Margetts your original post looks like you have worked out what a minority of Tory MPs are doing to you and your party Most of your reasons are addressed in Labour policy By not voting how do you get what you want The Tory party you want will never be voted in whilst the press and media back your extreme right wing MPs You are in the same position as Labour who can not get their views discussed  A decision on your part that you are unable to vote for anyone will not change anything and you will have to accept what it turned out you voted for,109,1,0.009174311926605505

How plan for cheap win over Gibraltar backfired on No 10 Source The Times Online 4417 Downing Street intended to hand Spain a cheap win over Gibraltar at the start of Brexit talks but miscalculated the scale of the domestic backlash senior officials claimed yesterday Olly Robbins Theresa Mays chief Brexit negotiator is said to have been instrumental in ensuring that the Rock was not explicitly mentioned in her letter triggering Article 50 last week The Department for Exiting the EUs permanent secretary backed by senior figures in No 10 is said to have anticipated that Gibraltar would be included in the EUs draft response but argued that it was strategically preferable that Spain made the first move They wanted to give Spain a cheap win What they didnt account for was that Gibraltar is one of those issues that can go off like a rocket a wellplaced figure at the heart of Brexit negotiations said However a government source said Our commitment to Gibraltar is clear and we do not recognise this account Mrs May moved to calm down the rhetoric after Lord Howard of Lympne one of her predecessors as Tory leader suggested on Sunday that she would be ready to go to war to protect Gibraltars interests Asked during a visit to Jordan whether she could rule out war with Spain Mrs May evoked Churchills dictum that it was always better to jawjaw than warwar What we are doing with all European countries in the European Union is sitting down and talking to them she said We are going to be talking to them about getting the best possible deal for the United Kingdom and for those countries Spain included Its definitely jawjaw Senior government sources insisted that Lord Howard had not been asked to make his intervention in which he said he was sure that Mrs May would show the same resolve as Margaret Thatcher had in the military campaign to recapture the Falklands in 1982 A No 10 spokesman said that the deployment of a Falklandsstyle task force isnt going to happen adding All that Lord Howard was trying to establish is the resolve that we will have to protect the rights of Gibraltar and its sovereignty Mrs May said Our position on Gibraltar has not changed We will be working with them as part of our negotiations to ensure that we get the best possible trade deal for the United Kingdom and the best possible deal for Gibraltar Alfonso Dastis the Spanish foreign minister said in response to Lord Howards comments The Spanish government is a little surprised by the tone of comments regarding Gibraltar coming out of Britain which is a country known for its composure After two days of confusion Fabian Picardo Gibraltars chief minister appeared to have caught up with Downing Streets original intention as he sought to put the best gloss on the affair He said that it was very helpful of Spain to have put this front and centre this early on in the process Some observers had expected an intervention by the Spanish at the final moments to throw a spanner in the works I think Spain has made a huge error of judgment not just in putting this early on but in effect denying their own citizens the application of that deal if they work in Gibraltar going forward said Mr Picardo Mr Dastis met David Davis the Brexit secretary for talks yesterday at the start of a planned twoday visit to Spain and Portugal Downing Street characterised the discussions as very friendly and very constructive adding that Mr Davis agreed that Britain would be steadfast in our support for Gibraltar Boris Johnson will also seek to calm tensions at a meeting with Sigmar Gabriel the German foreign minister in London today The foreign secretary will urge both sides to avoid references to divorce and say that the issue of security will not be used as a bargaining chip but neither should Gibraltar aides said,668,29,0.04341317365269461

So Greenpeace have gone to war against the Diesel engines that everyone was told to buy to stop global warming The Government has been ordered by the courts to come up with a plan by the end of the month The Mayor of London has decided to increase congestion charges for diesel cars Then it turns out that the newest cleanest Diesel engines are in cars because cars are changed more often than taxis busses or lorries and so have the latest technology and smaller engines So  only 10 of noxious gasses from Diesel engines in London come from private cars  while 90 doesnt  but private car owners are the only soft target being hammered financially Lets say half of them can change their cars in the next twelve months or just stop driving into London in them This means the noxious gasses will only be reduced by 5 and the least noxious of the noxious gasses at that but while the problem wont be solved the Mayor collects some more money from already overtaxed motorists Paint me cynical,179,2,0.0111731843575419

Given that the SNP and Greens were voted in with a convincing majority on a manifesto that highlighted promised an Independence referendum under the current sort of circumstances and that the majority of Scots 61 or so  Survation poll  so probably includes both NOs and Tories  think we need another Independence referendum I think youre on a sticky wicket there Besides as Brexit would be a major breach of the Scottish Constitution and so the Treaty of Union not to mention international law ending the UK irrevocably on the 25th March 2019 an Independence Referendum is the only way to save the UK by getting the Scots to vote for keeping the UK despite the Brexit problem The cowardice of the Conservatives Terrified Teresa and the Partys socalled leaders in trying to avoid that issue is not only betraying the Scottish Conservatives for whom they clearly have little but contempt but playing into the hands of the Scottish nationalists,159,9,0.05660377358490566

BENEFITS bosses axed a disabled womans Motability car to save cash but then agreed to pay out 000 to taxi her to and from work The bureaucrats first decided Jan Davis who suffers from multiple sclerosis no longer qualified for the disability allowance she used to pay for the car But just weeks later officers from the same Government department ruled she did qualify for help in getting to work They agreed to pay for a taxi to take Jan from Ayr to and from her job in East Kilbride 33 miles away The move which would cost the taxpayer an extra 000 a year was last night branded shambolic by her local MP Jan 58 who suffers excruciating pain had been receiving the Personal Independence Payment a nonmeans tested benefit and used this money to lease a Motability car But the Department for Work and Pensions DWP last month informed Jan she would no longer qualify after a snap reassessment of her benefits ruled she did not need the car to live independently Desperate to keep her job at HM Revenue  Customs Jan turned to the DWPs Access to Work scheme after taking advice from her MP To her surprise she was informed the DWP would pay for her to take a taxi to and from work despite a cost of almost 000 over three years compared with the cost of leasing a car over that period Last night Jan of Ayr blasted the DWPs approach saying Its crazy it would have cost them less than for me to keep the car and yet they are willing to pay up to 000 for taxis If you are a disabled person living on benefits your needs are ignored Im doing my best to continue working but I feel as though this Government just does not care httpswwwsundaypostcomfpmssuffererslamsawfulbenefitschiefswhoaxedhermotabilitycarinfavouroftaxis,307,12,0.03908794788273615

The vast majority of people failing to pay council tax simply cannot afford it Many of them have been affected by the welfare changes and reductions in benefits introduced since 2009 Failures in the administration of benefits meant that the numbers in default were already on the increase before 2013 but the problem has escalated after the removal of national council tax benefit which in theory at least protected lowincome adults In its place following the Local Government Finance Act 2012 more than 300 local support schemes now operate varying in detail between authorities and which may require all adults of working age to pay anything from zero to 45 per cent of the annual council tax even if unemployed or receiving meanstested welfare Yet at the same time these same adults are the ones who have seen their benefits cut as a result of the housing benefit caps the overall benefit cap the bedroom tax and sanctions on Jobseekers Allowance or their wages frozen For them council tax is now less a system of local taxation but rather a mechanism for creating debt httpwwwbigissuecomnewsgreatbritishcounciltaxscandalbigissueinvestigation,185,4,0.021621621621621623

At some point in the discussions following yet another terrorist attack some smarmy politician will pronounce those immortal words Lessons Have Been Learned After almost every unpleasant incident anywhere in UK these four words are trotted out and we all settle back into our armchairs reassured But like almost everything else spouted by UK media and UK politicians those four words are a blatant lie Lessons are not learned If they had been we wouldnt have yet another heartbroken Police Widow We wouldnt have more death on the street We wouldnt be rushing to appease the guilty and suppress all criticism Appeasement never works You cannot appease a bully Bullies scent weakness and keep pushing Ask Neville Chaimberlain who returned from a meeting with Hitler triumphantly waving his piece of paper Millions died We didnt learn that lesson We never learn lessons We British just stagger from crisis to disaster and back again We have done so throughout history We are never ready always believing it wont happen We always cut expenditure on defence and law enforcement until we are backed into a corner and fighting for our lives Somehow we survive no thanks to our so called leaders But now we are facing a different foe unlike anything we have ever faced before Insidious clever secretive Already well embedded into our society in positions of power and influence Settled into every day life And the home grown terrorists keep attacking MI5 has admitted publicly that they are dealing with over 400 threats inside UK alone They said it last night And thats just the ones they admit to or know about We as a nation and as a culture are under attack from within and we are in denial So much in denial that we send an unarmed policeman to guard the very centre of our nation He is now dead His wife a widow his children fatherless Alone this brave man faced a fanatic with a knife and he died so no politician dont lie to me Lessons have NOT been learned The ropes and sails on Nelsons ships were rotten when he faced his enemy at Trafalgar The Duke of Wellington had almost no heavy weapons to use at Waterloo In both World Wars the British forces were under resourced and the politicians didnt believe war would come And now today we send an unarmed policeman to guard the most sensitive establishment in Britain It beggars belief We as a nation rely on unarmed heros No hero should be unarmed or alone when he faces an enemy Lessons have Not been learned by politicians But the most important lesson who the British people vote for is in the voters hands Who did you vote for The same old lying bunch you voted for last time If you did that policemans blood is on your hands Think about that next time Red Blue or Yellow they have all lied and all failed,494,11,0.022267206477732792

So fecking true is this  they are allon the telly with their usual fluffy remarks  Welcome to London We can say were not afraid light candles and make hearts of our hands but the truth is that we cant go on like this Daily Mail yes it may be the Mail but its fecking bang on  They stood in the centre of Brussels Row on row Hands held high making hearts to the heavens Showing the slaughtered they were not forgotten Reminding themselves they were here with love Looking to show humanity wins That love conquers all They lay in the centre of London face down where they fell Stabbed by a knife rammed with a car flung broken into the Thames life bleeding out on the curb And the news came thick and fast An injured woman is assisted after a man drove a 4x4 into pedestrians along Westminster Bridge on Wednesday afternoon An injured woman is assisted after a man drove a 4x4 into pedestrians along Westminster Bridge on Wednesday afternoon A car rammed deliberately into pedestrians on the bridge Ten innocents down A police officer stabbed at the House of Commons Confirmed dead Another woman now dead at the scene Shots fired An Asian man rushed to hospital People make hearts with their hands during a ceremony in Belgium to commemorate the first anniversary of the bomb attacks in Brussels A woman plucked from the water And I grew colder And more tiny No anger for me this time No rage like Ive felt before No desperate urge to get out there and scream at the idiots who refused to see this coming Not even a nod for the glib idiots who say this will not defeat us that we will never be broken that cowardice and terror will not get the better of Britain Because as loyal as I am as patriotic as I am as much as my whole younger life was about joining the British military and fighting for my country I fear we are broken Not because of this ghoulish spectacle outside our own Parliament Not because of the lives rammed apart on the pavement even as they thought about what was for tea Or what train home they might make But because this is us now This is our country now This is what we have become To this we have been reduced Because all the while those forgiving fools in Brussels stood with their stupid hands raised in hearts to the sky another mischief was in the making More death was in the pipeline As the last lifeblood of a police officer ran out across the cobbles the attacker was being stretchered away in an attempt to save his life London is a city so desperate to be seen as tolerant no news of the injured was released No clue about who was safe or not Liberals convince themselves multiculturalism works because we all die together too An entire city of monkeys see no evil hear no evil speak no evil Blind Deaf And dumb Immersed in a seething pit of hatred hidden in pockets of communities plagued by old animosities and ancient strife These people may have left their lands But they have brought every tension every conflict every bit of fight here with them The Afghans hate the Somalis who loathe the Eritreans As it was before it is now London is a city of ghettos behind a thin veneer of civility kept polished by a Muslim mayor whose greatest validation is his fathers old job Sonofabusdriver Sadiq I see him now penning a missive about how London is a beautiful and tolerant city how we are united by shared values and understanding and how we will not be cowed by terror Sure enough there he was saying exactly that just now Fool Even as mothers text to check their children are safe Including my own worrying about me as I sit overlooking the scene feeling fearful of this place where monsters lurk and steal lives away in an instant For nothing I would ask Sadiq to stop talking Empty words Meanwhile banning pictures of women in bikinis on the Underground How does that help Please no hashtag no vigil no tea lights I am begging you not to light up Parliament in the colours of the Union Because we are not united We are wrenched asunder The patriots of the rest of England versus the liberals in this city The endless tolerance to those who harm us while the Home Office tries to shift the focus of public fear to white terror versus the millions like me who face the truth with worried families and hopeless hearts who feel the country sinking We are taken under the cold water by this heavy right foot in the south a city of lead so desperately wedded to the multicultural illusion that it can only fight those who love the country the most blame those who are most proud to be British and shout racist at the 52 This place is just like Sweden Terrified of admitting the truth about the threat we face about the horrors committed by the migrants we failed to deter because to admit that we are sinking and fast would be to admit that everything the liberals believe is wrong That multiculturalism has not worked That it is one big fat failure and one big fat lie President Erdogan of Turkey said there is a war being waged between the crescent and the cross But he is wrong Because the cross is not strong We are down on bended knee a doormat to be trodden on a joke only funny to those that wish us harm The war is between London and the rest of the country Between the liberals and the rightminded Between those who think it is more important to tiptoe around the cultures of those who choose to join us rather than defend our own culture How many more times And how many more attacks must pass before we acknowledge these are no longer the acts of extremists That there is no safe badge with which to hold these people at arms length in the way the liberals casually use the term farright for anyone who has National pride These events are no longer extreme They are commonplace Every day occurrences These people are no longer extremists They are simply more devout More true to their beliefs Beliefs which will be supported endlessly across our state broadcaster for the next few months until we buy into the narrative that one religion is not to blame That in fact we should blame Brexit supporters For believing in a Britain As it was before Anything but the truth This is why there is no anger from me this time no rage No nod for those who pretend we will not be cowed even as they rush home to text their mum they are safe No surprise that the city of which I was so proud is now punctured by fear and demarcated even more formally by places we cannot tread there were always parts in which a white woman could not safely walk Now I feel only sadness overwhelming sadness I will walk over the river tonight and look to the Thames to the Union flag lowered at half mast and the Parliament below and I will wonder just how much longer we can go on like this,1253,15,0.011971268954509178

I suppose we cannot continue bashing the Conservative for their total incompetence of running the country Lets look at what has gone wrong with Jeromy Corbyns leadership of the Labour party in making it the party of jokers and laughs Well lets look at it this way being such a weak leader he is not totally to blame There are a mixture of factors Some of these are beyond his control The existence of media hostility Attacking left wing politicians is what large sections of the media is for and anyone who is on the left needs to recognize that You could do absolutely everything right and they would still come after you Ideological fissures within the PLP These have always existed and always will Brexit being an incredibly difficult issue for the Labour Party This was always going to be the case If you come out full throated one way or the other you annoy a large section of your base Now you will note that these things are not binary  they exist on a continuum and good leaders are able to navigate around them and minimise the damage that they can do As an easy example you counter the existence of a hostile media by not making any dumb mistakes that can be pounced upon by the media and having a really disciplined operation And you silence critical members of the PLP by being able to woo them with potential office stressing the realistic possibility of Labour government Witness how under New Labour the more leftwing factions either shut up or were effectively sidelined Corbyns particular responses to those problems have not made it possible to minimise these problems Rather theyve been to exacerbate them Its been gaffe after gaffe Pointless own goal after own goal So the media and the Tories jump on it Nobody in the critical sections of the PLP thinks Labour has a chance next election so Corbyn simply has no effective power of patronage Dont criticise  you might be a minister in the Labour government of 2020 that will never happen Not a very effective message This crystalises as more and more members of the PLP becoming openly hostile to Corbyn At the start of his tenure it was only the most vocal members on the right of the party eg Chuka Umunna and Simon Danzcuk both of whom I was critical of on Quora at the time But by the time of the leadership challenge and noconfidence motion it was 80 of the PLP It wasnt just the usual suspects This does not happen under competent leadership Moving past that the fundamental thing that has gone wrong for Corbyn is that he and his team have been defined as a threat to national security economic security and my familys security Thats not my turn of phrase Its from a mailshot that was sent to me by the Tories immediately after Jeremy Corbyn was initially elected Labour leader I suppose many have had a good chuckle at that thinking it was hyperbolic guff and that it was far too extreme for the Tories to make stick After all Corbyn was basically a cuddly grandad figure albeit a cuddly grandad who has some unsavory associations But it has stuck And its stuck because Corbyn has repeatedly fallen into obvious national security traps Heres a sampling of Labour idiotics Saying you would never ever drop a nuclear weapon even if your party decided to keep them Shadow Chancellor and close Corbyn ally John McDonnell quoting Chairman Mao a guy most famous for causing the deaths of sixty million people in the House of Commons Whats more doing this when a sizable chunk of the electorate think you are an unreconstructed communist Protip if people think you are a communist try and distance yourself from actually existing communists Questioning shoot to kill in the immediate aftermath of the Paris attacks There are legitimate concerns over shoot to kill But wait until the blood is dry before talking about them People want to feel safe Insinuating that it is NATO that is primarily at fault after Russia has literally just invaded a sovereign country and be generally sceptical about NATO Saying that you might have nuclear missile submarines but without the nuclear missiles Saying that Bin Laden should have been arrested and that his death was a tragedy Saying that we need to have a discussion with Argentina over the Falklands No we dont They are British so long as the Islanders wish to remain British Which they do By overwhelming majority near unanimity There is nothing to discuss in light of these facts All of which when taken as a set make you a joke on national security for everyone who isnt already a paid up Corbynista Both Labour voters especially the sort that now have left and joined UKIP  and Tory voters care a lot about this sort of thing Unless you are minimally competent on national security you cant talk past your base And Corbyns base simply isnt big enough to win a

At some point in the discussions following yet another terrorist attack some smarmy politician will pronounce those immortal words Lessons Have Been Learned After almost every unpleasant incident anywhere in UK these four words are trotted out and we all settle back into our armchairs reassured But like almost everything else spouted by UK media and UK politicians those four words are a blatant lie Lessons are not learned If they had been we wouldnt have yet another heartbroken Police Widow We wouldnt have more death on the street We wouldnt be rushing to appease the guilty and suppress all criticism Appeasement never works You cannot appease a bully Bullies scent weakness and keep pushing Ask Neville Chaimberlain who returned from a meeting with Hitler triumphantly waving his piece of paper Millions died We didnt learn that lesson We never learn lessons We British just stagger from crisis to disaster and back again We have done so throughout history We are never ready always believing it wont happen We always cut expenditure on defence and law enforcement until we are backed into a corner and fighting for our lives Somehow we survive no thanks to our so called leaders But now we are facing a different foe unlike anything we have ever faced before Insidious clever secretive Already well embedded into our society in positions of power and influence Settled into every day life And the home grown terrorists keep attacking MI5 has admitted publicly that they are dealing with over 400 threats inside UK alone They said it last night And thats just the ones they admit to or know about We as a nation and as a culture are under attack from within and we are in denial So much in denial that we send an unarmed policeman to guard the very centre of our nation He is now dead His wife a widow his children fatherless Alone this brave man faced a fanatic with a knife and he died so no politician dont lie to me Lessons have NOT been learned The ropes and sails on Nelsons ships were rotten when he faced his enemy at Trafalgar The Duke of Wellington had almost no heavy weapons to use at Waterloo In both World Wars the British forces were under resourced and the politicians didnt believe war would come And now today we send an unarmed policeman to guard the most sensitive establishment in Britain It beggars belief We as a nation rely on unarmed heros No hero should be unarmed or alone when he faces an enemy Lessons have Not been learned by politicians But the most important lesson who the British people vote for is in the voters hands Who did you vote for The same old lying bunch you voted for last time If you did that policemans blood is on your hands Think about that next time Red Blue or Yellow they have all lied and all failed,494,11,0.022267206477732792

As a flower child hippie of the 60s making peace and not war was a given in our approach to conflicts Despite how heinous I still view any open warfare being declared this is still a defining line in the sand in a conflict where each side is open to attack or defend their countries and bear the consequences of such a declaration Since the threat of global warfare of the 60s have subsided there has been a shift to what has quaintly been referred to as freedom fighters or or more bluntly as terrorists ie indivividuals who claim to act or by organisations who claim they have acted on their behalf Either way when these activists kill in countries they consider to be against certain ideals they do so without warning or declaration in the clear knowledge that the incumbant country can take no action against any specific country as it is only a faction within Therefore such individuals are nothing more than spineless cowards who have not the morale strength but are literally waiting for an opportunity to stab a country in the back They should not be even given the name terrorists or given credence as representing any faction merely be termed murderers or in the case of UK citizens be called traitors to this country It is time for the politicians to call a spade a spade and call these cowards what they really are,239,5,0.02092050209205021

We voted for indeed but 48 did not and some of them were conservatives Now we have been abandoned completely  with no hint of compromise membership of EEA or single market  only a disastrous extreme Brexit This is why some of us life long Tories will no longer vote for this party At the moment they need not be bothered as there is not much position and we only can vote Lib Dem  but a week is a long time in politics and ignoring the 48 is not a good long term strategy When the effects begin to bite  not only the collapse of the currency but unemployment and inflation people will turn  the electorate is fickle,117,3,0.02564102564102564

Steve Patriarca the referendum was a manifesto pledge made by the Conservatives who were duly elected to government A Referendum Bill was passed in Parliament by more than 85 of MPs 33 and half million people voted in the referendum that followed which generated the largest ever democratic mandate in British history Since then the House of Commons has voted on the triggering of Article 50 with 75 of our MPs supporting the bill without amendment Not democratic Or not what YOU wanted,83,1,0.012048192771084338

Steve Patriarca Yes 48 did vote to remain but you cannot leave the EU and be a member of the internal market The clue is in the name The EEA is not an option as it still binds the UK This is why they are not compromises Its like saying we voted for the Conservatives but we did not vote for this part of the manifesto or that part of the manifesto The country voted to leave  that is  the ECJCustoms Union and Internal Market because  in essence that is the EU,92,3,0.03260869565217391

Reason for the mass borrowing Keynesian economics The labour party whilst in power never saved any for a rainy day whilst promising above inflation public sector wage increased along with a welfare system the country could not afford along with golden pensions for the public sector which spiralled out of control and when the ferris wheel stopped due to the financial crisis the big black hole they created was finally visible something needed to be done and the public voted to change that destructive government Now due to loose monetary policy and fiscal tightening we are now witnessing the gross unfairness of the system and the large income inequality gap due to the asset price inflation caused by loose monetary policy Yes the public did bail out banks the bonus issue I agree is hotly contentious however the country was within a week of all ATMs going empty The fractional reserve system we live in financially is so fragile that governments had no choice How do you wind up a bank whos balance sheet is 4X the British economy However people forget the tax payer invested so once market confidence and profitability reaches the banks our government will sell at a profit thus further assisting the reduction of the deficit or utilising that cash elsewhere in the economy,218,4,0.01834862385321101

Anthony no they did not unfortunately In addition what they did have was a vibrant economy and were part of the boom cycle of the business cycle Which if I remember correctly Mr Brown eliminated or so he thought I believe in a world where nuclear arms are still in possession of other countries we too should have a nuclear deterrent as geopolitics is as unstable today as it ever has been Corporation tax should be low to encourage job creation What needs to be done is a closing of loopholes of tax avoidance schemes for these corporates I dont know where you got 97bn from Austerity needs to occur to bring spending in line with revenues One doesnt need to be a mathematician to grasp the dynamics of income and expenditure The balance sheet of debt does need to be addressed which ever government is in power and i recall Labour were still going to cut 75bn should they of won in 2010 Lets also remember the country votes for austerity The biggest bulk of the debt is the bailout so irrespective of which party got power it would of still be there,194,5,0.02577319587628866
Luke SpencerHarrop Re the Tax Research link What Richard Murphy failed to do was look at the timing of borrowing though he did account for inflation For example borrowed in 1960 when the economy was much smaller is treated the same as borrowed in 2015 when the economy was much larger To me the 2 are significantly different Using a borrowing as a percentage of GDP would have been a better and more meaningful measure It also makes sense to look at the size of the population youre asking to repay this debt This would make per capita borrowing as a percentage of GDP an even better measure Ive used Richards data and combined it with GDP and midyear population estimates and come to quite different conclusions Both parties track record of per capita borrowing as a percentage of GDP is very volatile Up to 2010 Labour trailed the Conservatives in that since the start of the dataset they had higher cumulative per capita borrowing as a percentage of GDP per year in office It was always the case that a severe recession or boom could tip the balance Indeed the record of borrowing is much much more closely correlated to the global macroeconomic environment the government found itself in that whether the government was red or blue There are other factors which seem important to me that both I and Richard failed to account for We didnt look at how much new public debt was incurred to finance investment spending Thats important in deciding whether new debt is prudent Nor did we look at the effect of introducing time lags For example we both assumed that the fiscal position of the first year in office is attributable to the new government and isnt a hangover effect of the previous administration Adding a 1 or 2 year time lag may well have produced different results Nor did we look at the role played by private sector debt growth in increasing current GDP and tax revenues lowerinf deficits whilst depressing future GDP growth and tax revenues increasing deficits As an example between May 2000 and May 2008 UK households took on an extra of private debt That has massive fiscal impacts which show up as reduced deficits to 2008 and larger deficits when those debts are repaid Lastly Richards analysis totally omitted reference to the international picture whilst I only looked at in hindsight by visually comparing my graphs of UK per capita borrowing as a percentage of GDP to other country deficit trends It might have been better to weight UK deficits as a percentage of GDP against a basket of developed nation countries That way we wouldnt be scoring a year of high deficit spending badly when similar countries might have run even higher deficits than we did etc Basically Richard Murphy seems to be a busy man and though Im certain he could have done he didnt take the time to really get to grips with the data This piece has been very widely shared in Labour circles as a case for Labours fiscal prudence Im sure way beyond Richards expectations It serves as an interesting starting point but is a million miles from being a full analysis I hope to get back to this data once all my exams are out of the way in June My spreadsheet needs a tidy up to make it more comprehensible to anybody but me and I want to account for some of the other factors I mentioned As it stands though the picture for both parties is very volatile and up to 2010 Labour had a record of higher per capita borrowing as a percentage of GDP That reversed pretty quickly after 2010 placing the Conservatives as the higher borrowers I strongly suspect adding just a 1 year time lag to all the data would shift the position back in the Conservatives favour Adding in household debt growth is going to make the Labour record look terrible as they oversaw a massive housing bubble That record might be redeemed somewhat if we remember that a lot of the last Labour governments borrowing was to fund investment which should possibly be discounted Basically its messy and I wouldnt place very much weight on Richards analysis and certainly not the weight that has been placed on it since it was published,729,13,0.01783264746227709

It does make me laugh when Tories STILL blame Labour for everything even after theyve been in power for 7 years One can do a lot as prime minister in 7 years ie close tax loopholes oh no thats MUCH too difficult As we all know but Torys often like us not to remind them the UK national debt has always been lowest under LabourMargaret Thatcher caused the UK recession of the early nineties with her complete lack of underestanding of economics and although the Labour Party were in power in 2008 when the latest recession was announced  it was a WORLD recession that time remember in a new GLOBAL economy  think of that next time you slurp your Starbucks coffee or munch on your Lidl sandwichWaitrose Olives,128,8,0.0625

DEAR KEZIA Today the Scottish Parliament will begin a twoday debate on whether to seek permission to hold a second independence referendum The Scottish government wants to hold a referendum in the autumn of 2018 or the spring of the following year AFTER the BREXIT TERMS have been made reasonably clear It may well be that the Scottish government decide NOT to trigger a referendum IF the terms satisfy the priority interests of Scotland You will lead the Scottish Labour Party against the motion which is entirely your right though Jeremy Corbyn the leader of UK Labour confirmed then denied that he had said Scotland has the right to hold as many referenda as it wants depending on the will of the Scottish parliament Todays news empahsises yet again what a shambles the Labour Party is in  even Neil Kinnock commented this is far worse than the 1980s So go ahead and lead Scottish Labour against the motion under debate BUT be warned The true enemy is NOT the SNP it is the Tories under Ruth Davidson whose ambition is annihilate the Labour Party in Scotland Maggie Thatcher once declared her aim was to destroy Socialism forever in the UK an aim that has been taken up by Theresa May You yourself have become a laughing stock at Holyrood during the First Ministers Question Time as you stand up and PARROT whatever Ruth Davidson has just said Davidson reads her script sits down and you stand up and echo what she has just said The chamber is laughing before you finish your first sentence Once this debate is over the Tories will return to trying to decimate Labour councils throughout Scotland You are most unlikely to survive the debacle that follows UNLESS you get out to preaching LABOUR VALUES  which the independence issue aside are not that different from SNP values SOCIAL DEMOCRACY Finally it may well be that Scotland does NOT choose to leave the UK BUT it will have a greivance than can only be assuaged by further DEVOLUTUION amounting to a FEDERAL UNION between the nations Whether or not this would be a further step on the road to independence only time and the Will of the Scottish people can decide Yours sincerely The Sage of Auchtermuchy,380,14,0.03684210526315789

SUBVERTING DEMOCRACY Theresa Mays decision lto say no to a request from the democraticallyelected Scottish Parliament for a Section 30 order that would allow an independence referendum to take place on the same basis as the 2014 reversed more than four decades of British government policy which since the days of Harold Wilson has been that Scotland can only remain part of the United Kingdom by consent Margaret Thatcher always stated that if the SNP won a majority of Scottish seats at Westminster that would in itself be a mandate for independence By the time that target was actually met under David Cameron in 2015 it was felt that a referendum was the more appropriate way of securing a mandate But the constant has been that Scotland has a clearlyunderstood democratic path to independence which it can take at a time of its choosing No more The new Theresa May doctrine is that there is literally no way Scotland can express a view on its own future until such time as the PM decides for her own reasons that she is ready She makes no bones about the fact that the time may never come and that a key strand of the democratic process in Scotland may remain indefinitely suspended Mrs Mays argument is that of the wouldbe tyrant who wins one democratic election and says  We dont need any more elections Not in five years not in ten not in twenty That one was fine The SNP received 465 of the constituency vote in the 2016 election thats a bigger mandate than any UK government has received at a Westminster general election since 1966 more than five decades ago There are very few governing parties anywhere in Western Europe either at national or regional level that can boast of stronger public support than the SNP If it is to be seriously claimed that the Scottish government do not have a mandate to act its impossible to think of a government anywhere that has a mandate to do anything Certainly not the majority Tory government in London which was elected on the basis of just 37 of the UKwide vote and less than 15 of the Scottish voteand which is led by en unelected Prime Minister One image will linger long in the memory that of the defeated Scottish opposition leader Ruth Davidson being tasked with announcing what the elected Scottish government would not be allowed to do The Sage of Auchtermuchty thanks James Kelly,415,14,0.033734939759036145

There was a lot of bragging around the time of the referendum about the UK having the 4th or 5th largest economy in the world the argument being everyone would want to trade tarifffree with us whether we were in the EU or not because we constituted such a substantial market In August 2016 less than two months after the referendum a report entitled International Manufacturing Statistics was published by the Conservative government and no one seems to have batted an eyelid A cursory readthrough reveals some unbelievably worrying statistics which I thought I would share on the eve of the governments triggering of Brexit The essence of the report is that our manufacturing sector the sector in which we make goods to sell internally and to other countries is in serious decline See link below Here are three key points of the report 1 The UK has slipped from being the 5th or 6th leading manufacturing nation in the world from 1970 to 2004 to being 9th in 2014 Germany France Italy China USA Japan India and South Korea all produce more than we do 2 In terms of productivity the UK now ranks 29th  in the world in terms of output per head We are THE least productive country in the whole of western Europe in this respect barring Spain We are less productive than the Italians French Irish Belgians Finns Austrians Norwegians etc the list goes on and on We are 3 times less productive than the Swiss more than 2 times less productive than the Germans and 33 less productive than the Dutch We are ridiculously poorly educated lowskilled and poorlypaid compared with other countries and this why our productivity is so woeful in this respect 3 In terms of the percentage that the manufacturing sector contributes to GDP we are now 116th  in the world In 115 countries manufacturing contributes more to the wealth of the nation than in the UK Only 11 more or less 110th of our GDP comes from our manufacturing sector It is staggering that these statistics were not revealed to the British people in the runup to the referendum They highlight the true state of the fragility of the UK economy and how little in reality we have to sell to those countries we are now hoping to set up trade agreements with httpresearchbriefingsfilesparliamentukdocumentsSN05809SN05809pdf,394,16,0.04060913705583756

You say that one part of your plan is a united nation that our children and grandchildren are proud to call home My 10 year old granddaughter has decided that she does not want to follow any faith Your governments plans to allow statefunded faith schools to select an intake based 100 on faith grounds will clearly prejudice my granddaughter How do you expect my granddaughter to be proud of a nation that denies her a fair access to education at such an early age It is bad enough that independent faith schools create barriers between families within our communities but for state funding to be used to encourage exclusive faith schools within our communities is disgraceful I would like you to explain how the education reforms for faith schools can be anything but divisive I urge you to reconsider the current proposals,143,1,0.006993006993006993

The cowardly custards of the Conservative party are too terrified of the law and the constitutions of England and Scotland and the Union to risk agreeing any sort of test before the UK automatically ceases to exist in two years time As it stands trying to take Scotland out of the EU is clearly contrary to the will of the people of Scotland and therefore a basic breach of the Treaty of Union and the end of the UK The only way Westminster can legitimise the continuing existence of the UK with Brexit is to hold a referendum in which the will of the people of Scotland is clearly shown to be to Remain in the UK regardless of the EU issue IF May and her Westminster pals are serious about wanting to keep Scotland as part of the UK they need the referendum even more than we do rather than crouching scared in the benches of Westminster crying nonono otherwise on 30 Match 2019 its automatically the end of the Union,172,2,0.011627906976744186

Agreed Theresa May has decided to twist the increased awareness which people had back on disabled people by turning the idea that disabled people should be allowed to work if they so choose and have access to workplace accommodations which the employer must accept and not discriminate against into an unspoken necessity to work or lose all income thanks to an impossible assessment process combined with the treatment of a second class employee who can expect to be fired or paid less to the employers benefit The cherry on top being that if there is an emergency facing an understaffed and underfunded hospital which will be more likely not to give the care they need Just putting this comment on here as a wake up call to Conservative voters who are living in ignorance of the harm done by this party,141,0,0.0

Even at the height of her powers and authority Maggie Thatcher never treated any part of the United Kingdom with the dismissive contempt that Theresa May is showing towards not just the Scottish government but the whole of Scotland and the Scottish people On the 15th of July 2016 Theresa May told First Minister Nicola Sturgeon she was willing to listen to options on Scotlands future relationship with the European Union The prime minister said Im willing to listen to options and Ive been very clear with the first minister today that I want the Scottish government to be fully engaged in our discussion Since then Mrs May has done exactly the opposite by REFUSING TO EVEN DISCUSS THE OPTIONS presented by the Scottish government During that meeting in July 2016Mrs May declared 1 Scotland is an EQUAL partner in the UK and b Scotland should take the LEAD in helping to getting the best out of any new politicial system Doesnt that sound hollow and hypocritical now By refusing to discuss these options Mrs May FORCED Miss Sturgeon to request permission to hold a second independence not tomorrow not next week not ecen next year but 18 months from now when FACTS about the UKs exit from the EU will be known If it turns out as Mrs May keeps assuring us it will the case for Scottish independence might collapse so Mrs May has little to lose in granting permssion After all the First Minister of Scotland and her Scottish government WERE ELECTED by the people of Scotland to represent them Theresa May HAS NEVER BEEN ELECTED by anyone Nicola Sturgeon shows the utmost respect for the sovreignty of her Parliament Theresa May attempts to undermine it by forcing the issue to go to the Supreme Court who threw her out by a vote of 11 to 1 David Cameron will go down in the history of the UK as the Prime Minister who gambled his countrys place in the EU and lost it Theresa May will almost certainly go fown in history as the Prime Minister who risked the unity of the UK and lost Scotland When the people of Scotland realise the humiliating way Theresa May has treated their country they will not forget and they will not forget Theresa May should keep in mind the face of Maggie Thatcher tears and misery on her face as she left 10 Downing Street for the last time Few Tory Prime Minsiters leave office with honour and most leave because they have been stabbed in the back by their own Tory colleagues One day Mrs May they will come for you,443,14,0.03160270880361174
