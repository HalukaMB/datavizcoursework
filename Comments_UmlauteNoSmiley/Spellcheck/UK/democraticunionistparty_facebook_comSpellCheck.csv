Leaving the EU is a terrible idea and the VAST majority of economists and economic think tanks are all of the opinion that it will adversely affect the UKs medium to long term financial outlook But well done on linking a Torygraph opinion from 7 years ago written during a global financial crisis Im astounded at Unionists voting for Brexit Mrs May has signed the UKs death warrant today Scotland will leave and its only a matter of time before England tires of subsidising us Talk about turkeys voting for Christmas The DUP have destroyed our country and Brexit has made my childrens future a much more uncertain place Oh and FYI they come up to shop here because the pound is so weak wonder why that is,128,8,0.0625

Arlene Foster attends the Church Of Ireland She mustnt realise that her own Church in its 39 Articles says Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses in the which it was commonly said that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead to have remission of pain or guilt were blasphemous fables and dangerous deceits Rather than the question of should she attend the funeral of a terrorist The first question should be can she as a so called protestant attend a blasphemous service,85,1,0.011764705882352941

In Arlene Fosters Christmas statement back in December she stated that Jesus Christ is the author and perfecter of our faith He is light of the world healer and forgiver of all sins and assuming that she does believe this I would like to hear how she can justify her attendance at the Roman Catholic Mass Her church The Church Of Ireland in regard to the Roman Catholic Mass states Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses in the which it was commonly said that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead to have remission of pain or guilt were blasphemous fables and dangerous deceits in its 39 Articles Many victims have been insulted and offended by Arlenes actions in attending the funeral of an unrepentant terrorist But most importantly she has attended a blasphemous service which is an insult to the same Christ she professed in her statement our Saviour Our faith in God should come first before anything no matter what the consequences are At the Judgement day we will not be judged by an electorate but rather by the Almighty God and we will all be held to account for our actions during our time here on earth In the light of this statement I would like to know how Arlene can justify her attendance at the Requiem Mass I look forward to your response,230,1,0.004347826086956522
Mcguiness was not a peace maker what he was  was an unrepentant terrorist who changed tactics  The really worrying reality is that the SF has been dominating the agenda  making the rules up and are holding the political initiative We need leadership not capitulation We need a clear plan and forceful leadership In 2 electoral cycles SF will be dominant unless we make it clear we will not be pushed around and that we have our demands SF obvious strategy is to dominate the Irish government which includes the Irish armed forces  the permutations of that situation are horrifying We need to wake up to our situation ,107,1,0.009345794392523364

Come on the Unionist side was every bit as guilty The UVF were scum just as much as the IRA Even as a proud Briton when I look back on the disgraceful history of the British in Ireland I can understand why the Republicans began an armed struggle The peace process should have begun LONG before McGuinness became a vital part of the peace process and the subsequent settlement precisely BECAUSE of his past Dont forget he witnessed the Bloody Sunday murders one of the most disgraceful episodes in the British Armys history No wonder he wanted revenge The way he put all that behind him and angrily denounced the dissidents proved to me that he was a great politician however much I disagreed with his policies and end goals,130,4,0.03076923076923077

Gerard maybe you need to combine a history lesson with the geography Ulster predates the lines drawn by the English for administration purposes It size and shape varied along natural geographical features prior to that,35,1,0.02857142857142857
Maurice Robinson might I suggest that we move on from a politics that rests in fear and emotional tribal responses Unionism has to be about more than resistance if its to remain relevant Ms Foster has been embarrassed and routed by democracy Democracy demands that she be replaced Democracy might call for another election if the DUP insist that Ms Foster is its nominee for FM Where will the party finish then,72,1,0.013888888888888888
I totally agree politics should not be about fear and tribal responses but you will find theres always going to be Unionists and Nationalists in N Ireland Unionism is a very broad church but fundamentally its about promoting the Union which is a very positive thing Democracy demands that she stays the First minister comes from the largest party and thats the DUP Its not the DUP who chose Ms Foster it was the people of N Ireland,78,4,0.05128205128205128
Gerard Flanaganyou really need to get your facts and history straight parts of ulster which is a province of Ireland are in the Republic the majority of ulster is in nIreland whose border was drawn up after partition in 22 after a democratic vote 6 counties chose to remain in the UK and formed nIreland the other 3 whose majority wanted to form a new state are in the Republic history is history democracy has to be followed we cant cherry pick the bits we like and dont like eg the brexit vote,93,6,0.06451612903225806
Harry Topping Generally I take your point but when you mention history maybe a bit of clarification needed Northern Ireland actually came into being in 1921 before the rest of Ireland seperated from the UK The Irish state negotiated a seperation by a delegation from the illigitimate Sinn Fein Government It was then passed by the Sinn Fein cabinate It was also passed by the illigitimate Government in Dublin as well as the legitimate Irish Parliament the UK Westminster Government in Parliament and the UK House of Lords The Irish Free State certainly had democratic legitimacy but it was not put to a vote for the whole population of the Irish Free State The Irish Free State came into existance in 1922 Northern Ireland having already been established with the consent of its people in 1921 was irrelevent to the Irish Free State decision Although the Irish Free State electors did not have a referendum as such they certainly overwhelmingly backed the politicians who set up the Irish Free State in the next election there,175,11,0.06285714285714286
Con Conghaile Arlene led our party to an increased vote across Northern Ireland That is a fact We have returned as the largest Party That is a fact If the leader of any other party had done this in any other country we would have been celebrating this leaders great victory Yet all the media can do is suggest she has somehow failed Absolutely absurd Across Northern Ireland we increased our vote Fact We have the largest party and the largest vote of all parties Fact Democracy demands my choice is listened to along with the largest voting group in Northern Ireland A lot is talked about respect I demand our democratic choice be respected,115,1,0.008695652173913044

Hetty Davis in all honesty I am already really enjoying talking to you I was raised Irish Catholic and Ive honestly never talked to a Protestant or even hardly talked to anyone from the north Doesnt that sound so ignorant of me I am a little embarrassed haha but this is really exciting for me So to me Ulster is just a Providence of Ireland however I imagine it is different to you Concidering you see it as part of the UK Walter Graham that is an interesting idea hahaha I guess it would be kind of like what you guys have I dont know that I would necessarily hate it however I cant imagine Canada wants to be part of America Arlene Sloan yes the republic is not there yet And as to the civil war comment my instinct is to say well certainly we will get the Brits out by any means necessary however I am trying to look at it differently as it seems there are Irish in the north that like being part of the UK Which leads me to ask if you consider your selves Irish See that is very interesting to me because Ive always believed that you couldnt possibly be Irish and part of the UK Ive lately talked in length to people in the republic who thought it was an absolutely atrocity for a Republican to vote in why they called a British election And they actually really despise Sinn F ,249,11,0.04417670682730924
Roger Fessenden yes Roger they do not like SF they never do well in the republic of Ireland elections I was reading the Sunday life paper yesterday and if you check it out they make it quite clear they want nothing to do with them Its sad Roger you never spoke to protestant before now I have many friends and actually relations who are catholics and have done so for many years I think the catholic people in the north of Ireland know now they are better off being part of Britain and starting to change Roger the IRA did more to divide people than you can imagine it caused so much hatred going up in the sixties as a young teenager I new nothing of catholic or protestants my parents brought the family up never talking about religion they too had catholic friends yes I was sent to Sunday school which now Iam so thankful for and we were poor but I loved my childhood exciting times then for me too as the Beatles had just came out lol so when the civil rights marches started and the IRA began their violence I was taken back at all this as I never could understand at first what it was all about but they really have alot to answer forI also think the republic of Ireland dont want us I wish they could have a poll and ask them I would be interested to know tell me something Roger where you brought up here  and then moved to America,259,7,0.02702702702702703
No sadly I wasnt it was my grandmother who is the latest of my family to move to America and she wont talk about her child hood Before that my grandfather knows hes Irish but hasnt said how far back they came over My dad always taught us we where Irish but never explained politics or religion to us Im the only one in my immediate family who really cares to learn about that stuff Ive just never had the oppertunity when ever Ive met or talked to someone from Ireland they where from the republic and again never wanted to go into politics or anything Ive seen that certainly agree that the IRA in the 70s 80s where awful I always believed it was because Britain made them criminals and so they started to act like criminals As a Republican and a person who hopes for Irish freedom I am very sorry for the way the IRA did things in the more recent years My thoughts also have been compare 20 or so years of terror from the IRA to the 800 years of terror from England I think its easy for me to say we should have unity by any means however I am trying to change that view point and to be honest it was Sinn F who made me start to change that thought Because they keep campaigning for equal rights for all Irish and I am working on realizing there are some Irish that dont want a united Ireland at this time and so I wanted to understand what the was that those people thought so we could move twords a united Ireland which would be good for all Irish,285,13,0.0456140350877193
I think a lot of the people in the republic have that same mind set that we need unity at any cost And that they havent taken the step to wonder if that would be the best thing for all Irish I talked to someone recently who said that the best sign of unity hed seen was taking a gaelic class that had some unionist in it and seeing them start to embrace the language and the culture and each other and I thought we might ought to do the same thing Try to understand where you guys come from because it would be us joining you as much as you joining us and I would want both sides to want the unity otherwise its not really unity It would almost be in my eyes the same thing the English did,141,3,0.02127659574468085
Roger Fessenden well Roger the English owned all of Ireland to start with then the uprising happened and Ireland was given 26 counties and Ulster was formed but the IRA wanted it all they were never happy with this outcomeYou could look at Ulster like the Scottish or Welsh who have their own identities but still part of the UK I wouldnt want an all Ireland and be under Rome and also I think we are much better off here but the ballot box is the only answer I go down south quite often and find the Irish people great people who just want to make a living I also think SF played on the Brexit vote as well and there is also more people of different nationalities here now tooBut if an united Ireland came about civil war is not the answer,143,5,0.03496503496503497
Its so hard for me to realize that anyone likes the English hahaha I feel like theyve always just invaded other peoples land and claimed it as their own took what they could and killed any natives that opposed Not just Ireland but in most of the countries around the world And I realize America does similar things so you could ask how could I be proud to be an American and you would have a good point I guess all I could say would be well this is where I was born and raised and I have to look at the bright side Is it the same for the UK I guess May I ask why you would prefer to be part of the UK is it economical or cultural or religious I asked a young man I met who was a law student from Dublin why he thought the north was still separate concidering I had to imagine religion isnt as big a factor as it used to be and he said that it was just a matter of thats how things have always been and its hard for people to change Also since you mentioned it do you think the UK should go on with the Brexit When I first heard that England wanted to leave the EU I thought there was no way they would actually do that and now that they have Id hope there is no way that the Celtic nations under English rule would accept it,253,6,0.023715415019762844
Roger Fessenden I dont know much about the Norman invasion in Ireland in the late 12th century just a bit but I know the British involvement was due to this and it took place in a matter of stages to long to explain anyway God has placed us where we are today you and I both so we have to make the best of our lives and what we have I dont want a united Ireland first because of the influence the Catholic church has over predominantly Catholic countries dont know if this is still the same nowadays in Ireland for I think people are changing second I do believe we are better off financially you see I dont understand how Ireland voted for gay marriage when clearly the Catholic church is against this As for Brexit I voted to leave the EU we did alright before we joined and I would like to get the chance to go it alone again there again it was up to the ballot box to decide and Iam glad we are leaving for we pour millions into the EU dont know how much we get back into the economy but a suppose time will tell if it was a good decision or not  Hope Iam answering all your questions Roger,217,11,0.05069124423963134
You are this is so wonderful for me I really appreciate the difference in view point its so interesting As you mentioned I think the fact that Ireland voted for gay marriage is a great example of how Ireland is moving away from the traditional Catholic rule and it made me very excited not just because I support gay rights but also because I see that Ireland is changing and I think that it shows that soon we will be able to accept everyone as the proclamation promised so long ago Also if you havent read the Easter proclamation its really a beautiful document to me I think there are a lot of people in the republic who need to read it and take it to hard there is a beautiful part that talks about equality that I think the world needs to read In regards to the history I found a good video that explains it on YouTube a brief history of conflicts in the north that seemed to me refreshingly unbiased they didnt mention anything about the potato famine being genocide or the how the English transported a lot of innocent Irish to Australia or sold them as slaves to plantains in the Americas However the video was good As for the Brexit I hope for the best for Scotland Wales and the north If its good for you then more power to it as you said well have to see what the polls say Again thank you very much for your time like I said this is so wonderful and interesting to me still a little confusing haha but its really a learning experience,277,5,0.018050541516245487
Roger Fessenden your welcome Roger lets hope there are better times ahead for everyone I think people know alot about religion but not about Christianity one of the reasons I vote for DUP is their Christian values which I try to live byI hope Ive helped you understand a little bit better so when you hear news of NI good or bad youll see it abit different Ive been to America a few times in one visit we went on a trip to the Grand Canyon spoke to the Hualapai Tribe very interesting had tea with them heat was unbearable lol lovely people so I suppose Ive seen both sides of the coin so to speak so lets hope its been the same for you Roger dont be afraid to ask anything and I will check out the video and read the proclamation but first I wish you good health and God Bless you and your family,157,12,0.07643312101910828

Roger Fessenden  so you are not irish if you were born in America  you just have irish ancestors So why would you prefer a united ireland America supported the Ira by providing them with money guns etc Thats how they were able to murder so many innocent people It would be more fitting if you concerned yourself with your own politics which leaves a lot to be desired And yes I am a Northern Ireland protestant Have you never heard of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland I am British and proud,95,6,0.06315789473684211
Ruby Hanna I would prefer a united Ireland because in short I believe that the Irish are the greatest race of people in history I am very proud of my Irish heritage and I am certain if it wasnt for my Irish blood I wouldnt be half as strong as I am Furthermore I believe that it is evident god intended Ireland to be one nation by the fact that it is one island I believe as it was stated in the proclamation that the right to Ireland is to the Irish people that they are equal united and free That they are undivided by differences fostered by an alien government in the past I believe in the words of Pearse that Ireland unfree will never be at peace Thats why I am here to try to understand the point of view of the Irish in the north so that when Ireland moves for her freedom I will be educated on what it will take for everyone to feel included Like I said earlier as someone you supports the fight for a united 32 county Ireland I am very sorry for the way the IRA operated between the 70s and 90s it is regrettable whenever an innocent life is taken Of course were still waiting on an apology from England for the millions of lives taken through out history in several nations around the globe including ireland I do concern myself with my own politics however we in America arent under English rule we took care of that a long time ago If you are Irish I consider you my sister and friend as I have with Hetty although we have different ideas I greatly respect and appreciate her position and I hope that whatever happens for Ireland in the future is good for her as well as any Irish person north or south Catholic or Protestant As is outlined in the proclamation If you are English it is my opinion that you certainly could feel welcomed in Ireland however should respect the fact that Ireland belongs to the Irish As I believe anyone should respect that England belongs to the English and Scotland the Scots for that matter Obviously I have heard of the UK and NI thank you for your concern though I do appreciate your thoughtfulness especially concidering our differences Certainly you have a right to be proud of your heritage as I am mine and entitled to your opinion as I am as well Which is that a proud Englishmanwoman must be an uneducated Englishmanwoman lol Of course I mean no disrespect and that is just my opinion in a bit of craic Thank you again for your time and comment,455,15,0.03296703296703297

Hetty Davis I didnt recognize the title but when I looked it up I recognized the tune an a couple lines my grandmother has sung this before I am very glad that you have enjoyed talking to me I certainly have enjoyed talking with you Have you had a chance to read the proclamation I think it is really wonderful Also if I could share a song with you I like the song the Fields of Athenry Mizu Canning isnt it wonderful This has been a much better conversation than many I have had with my fellow Republicans in the south It is wonderful ,104,5,0.04807692307692308
Roger Fessenden yes Roger I have read it the part that stands out for me is  We place the cause of the Irish Republic under the protection of the most High God Whose blessing we invoke upon our arms and we pray that no one who serves that cause will dishonour it by cowardice inhumanity or rapine  so the IRA by starting its terrible murderous so called war has really dishonoured the very proclamation itself they were responsible for some of the most inhuman atrocities dividing the people apart and causing so much bitterness It has taken us years to get were we are today and still there is a deep division We cant turn the clock back unfortunately but we can as I say hope for a better future for everyone thats why I remember my childhood with happiness hatred gets you nowhere like it or not we have to live together and life is short to say the least youll realize that Roger when you get old God willing Look up Ruby Murray she came from the Donegal road in Belfast and she had lots of songs in the top 20 in the fifties just shows how popular she was with everyone when my mum and dads friends came round they took it in turns singing her songs everyone had a party piece like 40 shades of green beautiful song or a little piece of Heaven Galway Bay to name a few I wonder were we would have been today if all violence hadnt started but well never know our past could have been so different given a chance,271,4,0.014760147601476014
Yes Hetty Davis you are absolutely right I am glad that you noted that The IRA in the later years did dishonor the cause and that is something that I think a lot of Republicans get mad at me for and I was recently called orange and other things for my apologizing for the actions of the IRA where I feel it is intact necissary for us to acknowledge that the IRA was wrong and apologize for it And hope they never resort to the same behavior If a Republican heard me say that they would say I was spitting in the face of the cause and I think that is extremely unfortunate that there are any Republicans that think that way I am very happy that you read it I think it is an absolutely beautiful document and if more people understood it like you did right away and took it to heart the world would be better off I believe as a Republican one needs to understand and respect the proclamation and if they did there wouldnt be acts of hate Anyway I hope you enjoyed reading I think it really is so beautiful Ahahaha life is definitely short Im already noticing it now I have no idea where my last 5 years went and Im only 20 now haha But yes I agree I tell people all the time that life is to short to be upset or angry all the time Choose to be happy and peaceful And thank you I will look them up perhaps I will recognize more of them I know Galway bay and Ive heard many references to 40 shades of green And yes again I agree with you we cant change the past all we can do is move on from here I actually have a tattoo on my chest that represents that concept Hetty as always its been wonderful ,319,11,0.034482758620689655

Fiona Winchester i dont think the word fear is appropriate ireland has had a border since 1921 thats nearly 100 years ago so unionists today have no idea what a united ireland would involve so how can they fear it just as people living in the irish republic have no idea either the problem is that we have politicians in northern ireland who cant even say the words northern ireland yet talk about respect and about equality for all No one in northern ireland is treated like a second class citizen a Catholic can go to the same hospital use the same doctor and dentist go use the same pub hotel or restaurant work in any career they choose Have the same opportunities in life as any protestant hope this answers your question,133,10,0.07518796992481203

When the RHI inquiry truth comes out and is known if there is power sharing at that time the DUP should collapse it again to give the public the chance to pass their verdict SF prevented a preliminary report and the inquiry going a head earlier why We heard Gildernew saying how SF made a mistake fielding 4 candidates in fermanagh south tyrone last time so they only run 3 this year This was about republicans wanting a rerun again and attacking unionists when the DUP looked venerable For goodness sake DUP when inquiry findings are public please force another election,101,7,0.06930693069306931
I think it is very likely that DUP could have attained more seats if the leader of UUP Nesbitt hadnt not indicateed UUP voters could vote for so calle dprogressive parties ie SDLP I believe this transfer has possibly in some crucial areas put an SDLP candidate in as opposed to DUP In future the leaders of all unionist parties must work together Nesbitt going is the correct way for unionism in my view Whether Arlene stands aside for a period is her and the DUPs choice but I believe she will be ok we will wait to see what the enquiry says about the Sinn Fein role Its possible that there may well be another election This isnt just about what Sinn Fein wants unionist want a lot too like legacy in terms of justice slaughtered men and women and their families this will never go away and in absence of resolution and the political will it remains a thorn in the side of republicanism justice doesn ot go down a one way street look at the scales of justice,181,22,0.12154696132596685

open letter to unionists in Northern Ireland yes Northern Ireland the name that decent honest democratic people call this country we pay our taxes in receive salaries and get welfare benefits My community rather than vote for change came out in higher numbers to vote in the sectarian opportunist party known as SIN fein whilst a minority like myelf voted in the moderate and inclusive SDLP I know that many uionists switched their vote away from the DUP but nt enough although i understand that you are suspicious of sin fein and the nationalist voters who seem to vote in that party no matter what controversy or scandal they are involved in sin fein say they are the party of respect but openly praises ira murderers despite saying they want to move forward  i see little respect to Protestants in this country from sin fein just want you to know that not all nationalists support sin fein i certainly dont and never will but DUP you have to try work for all in this country and not get sucked in by sin fein spin and the mindless sectarian bigoted sheep that vote them in,194,17,0.08762886597938144

Makes no odds who is in power at stormont Our future is bleak in ni as a result of brexit Brussels and london will decide our future Cost of goods to business has risen almost 20 in past 3 months and inflation will sharply rise resulting in high cost of living Also it was the Dup that split the unionist vote when they started their party opposition with uup,69,6,0.08695652173913043
A Brexit future offers far more than an EU one the rest of the world offers much more opportunity  the EU is a failed entity and has been using the UK as cash cow Keep an eye out and watch it eventually burn Brussels wont be deciding our future either in fact legal experts have very recently stated that the UK dont need to make any divorce settlement On the DUP it was formed because the UUP wasnt looking after the unionist people particularly the working class and they believed they had the right to peoples votes  the people soon disabused them of that,104,5,0.04807692307692308

Arlene Foster has cleverly manoeuvred SF into a brilliant negotiating position I cant see any benefit to Sinn Fein getting back into bed with the DUP They tried that for 10 years while the DUP regularly held their noses Another few years of administering British rule  Tory austerity for SF when they have no longer any electoral pressure to do so Better for SF to play hard to get Force the Brits into direct rule hammer them at every turn draw the Irish government in under joint authority  expose their weaknesses All the while building the SF power base north  south  forcing the issue on border referendum SF are boxed in to a winwin situation Well done Arlene,118,5,0.0423728813559322

the other reality is that if there was a UK referendum next week on whether the rest of the UK should jettison Northern Ireland probably about 80 of the people there would vote yes They have long ago stopped caring about us and our petty little squabbles Our BIG election didnt even make a paragraph on the front page of national newspapers We are just an annoying little thorn in the side now and thats the reality You can march up and down the street waving your union jack all day and paint all the kerbstones red  white and blue but the sad truth is the rest of the UK are simply just sniggering at our behaviour  they care very little about NI these days When the history books are opened Arlene probably be remembered as the unionist minister whose arrogance over RHI to unionists as well as nationalists kick started the slow decline of the union here,158,4,0.02531645569620253

Hay Ive in idea lets stop going back 1000s of years and live in the present The famine happend because of a blight on the potato crop due to gready farmers trying to suck as much profit out of the land  It was a very sad time in Irelands history but all parts of the British Isles were in the same boat  But its time to stop blaiming England for every thing that happend in Ireland The church had plenty of opertunitys the help the poor They still put their hand out for collections for the church knowing people were struggling but thought if they gave to the church their God would help them Ive never heard any catholic group condemning the church for doing nothing  And where did the people go   Many who could went to America but the rest were taken in by England and Scotland Yes they had to work hard but they were still better off many went on to be some of the most successful and richest people in Britain  The majority stayed in their new adopted homes knowing they were better off than going back to home to the old country,197,9,0.04568527918781726

The heading on this post is the most accurate statement the DUP have made in many years It is time for the individuals in the DUP ranks who are more interested in personal gain and power to step aside and allow true Unionists onto the stage The rot started with the personal ambition of Ian Paisley to be the leader of NI and there was no price too high to achieve his goal He was prepared to and did divide the Unionist community a division that has deepened over the years To end up in a situation as we witnessed in this election where the leader of the UUP urged through his actions for Unionists to transfer votes to a Nationalist party to further his personal ambition was akin to Paisleys actions of the past dividing Unionism We are now at the last chance saloon and unless we can recover Unionist unity with individuals devoid of greed and personal ambition with a genuine desire to strengthen our position in the Union we have lost the battle A strong united Unionist Party can create a fair society in NI where everyone regardless of religious belief can be proud to live Republicans will always aspire to a united Ireland we can maintain that as a pipe dream only through unity strong leadership and fairness to all,224,3,0.013392857142857142
A fair society you say lol  Where everyone regardless of religious belief blah blah  all undone with your final statement of letting them uns have their pipe dream So leading us yet again back to the same Situation we are currently in  News flash Your so called Unionist Ideals and i know this doesnt apply to everything because most of you all are quite nice people when not fighting over Orange or Green are the biggest divider you have The DUP and their believes will continue to force the Younger generations to turn on them because of one simply fact they are idiots,103,5,0.04854368932038835
If you have not yet realised it the question of maintaining the Union verses a United Ireland is and always will be the main divider of people within NI If you would broaden your outlook and look at what Ive written the aim of Unionism should always be to keep the aspirations of Republicans a pipe dream A fair society would ensure that people of every religious persuasion would recognise the benefits of the Union over a United Ireland Of course there are those who committed murder and destruction in their quest of their aspirations sadly too many of the younger generations and others chose to ignore this,108,1,0.009259259259259259

Why are republicans so concerned about scotland leaving the United kingdom  Yet there prepared to kill to get northern Ireland to join the so called free state But then their hardly free when they have masters in Brussels governing every thing they do its almost a dictatorship Thats not freedom when the EU are practicaly telling you when you can shiteThey will be dictating how irish stew should be made next Sooner Britain gets out the better  perhaps we should call ourselves the free nation  But apart from us gaining our freedom people dont have to panic  Scotland will not be leaving the UK and neither will northern Ireland not in our lifetime anyway  As for joining the commonwealth Im sure if south Africa can participate so could the free state sorry shouldnt realy call it that lets just say southern Ireland But I dont actualy think there being asked,150,11,0.07333333333333333
If the republic buy 40 of our exports they must need the goods  And it must be cheaper to buy from northern Ireland or they wouldent do it  Are there now prepared to stop the mutual trade between us and pay far more for goods the will then have to import and pay lots more for  I dont think they are that daft  We need each other and I cant see north or south cutting their own throats ,78,2,0.02564102564102564

Heather Robinson if our laws are NOT backwards then the rest of the UK laws must be backward as they actually permit same gender marriage Could it be that the rest of the UK and ireland is not influenced by religious fundamentalism the way this statelet is Of course it doesnt end at same gender marriage it was also about gay blood and gay couple adoption Have you looked at the voting record in Westminister of the DUP on any issue which attempted to give members of the LGBT community equal rights they voted against itin fact they wanted to make it homesexuality illegal again Now forgive me for thinking otherwise but this party is so backwards that it has never given anything willingly and has had to be dragged screaming to the negotiating table Their day has come and gone and it is NOT coming back,147,8,0.05442176870748299

Heather Robinson I take absolute umbrage at your comment regarding morals Just because people myself included do not follow religious doctrine does not mean that we are lacking morals I have a very strong moral compass regarding how we should treat others in society In fact I would argue that a lack of religion actually enforces a more tolerant more accepting less discriminatory attitude in which we accept the differences between us and accept a live and let live attitude towards our fellow man I and others like me respect others on the basis that we are all first and foremost human beings and not because some religious text dictates how we should live our lives or how we should treat others because of their differences,126,0,0.0

To be quite honest I would like the agenda for DUP to look at University Fees Education especially the retention of Grammar Schools and the type of assessment and try to retain some primary schools in country areas even if they could share activites and be able to cater for lesser able children with good support assistants Next would be health and it really needs re structured there appears to be wastage at times The last thing though important would be housing My mother waited from she got married in 1938 and had me in 1939 and she could not get a house This was war time but also a hob nob unionist Government in Stormont and my dad tried to get somewhere near a school DUP came along and thank goodness for Ian Paisley he promised new houses would be built in one year and people living in damp houses would get first and it happened Mums neighbour was a Catholic and she told mum she would love to speak to him and he tpld her she was one of Gods children and he didnt care where she worshiped she needed a house badly and he would see she got it There were over 50 families that enjoyed a life changing way of life thanks to him and that is the party who cared when Terrance Oneill and the upper class treated the working man very badly and now Ians son is diong a fantastic job in Westminster so this is a party I will always be thankful for,260,10,0.038461538461538464

Something very very controversial a friend of mine posted on this pagewhich has since been removed I wonder why  So its a week since I posted my passionate primary political rant with all my views on the election and I have since been embroiled in some banter debate and discussion with people I dont know Ok I admit Im voting Alliance but I have been posting some thought provoking comments on both the SF DUP facebook page nothing negative just asking questions promoting ideas alternatives They are the parties I have issues with Of note I have been putting DUP supporters minds at rest as they seem to be obsessed with impending unification eg one poor old lady stated SF number one and only priority was a united Ireland So I was able to reply to her quoting their manifesto of which it is one vague paragraph I reminded her that UK and RoI would have to agree and it was years awayShe will be long gone I suggested she consider other parties if she was voting out of fear now I have assuaged her worry Imagine my surprise my confusion my anger when yesterday when I went looking for her feedback I find that every single comment I had ever made on the DUP facebook was removed and I was not longer permitted to comment on their page That in itself is pretty outrageous but what is worse is the DUP are happy to leave vile and nasty comments from nationalists about the party leader calling her a pig about her short hair clothes etc they are happy to leave comments from nationalists our day is coming SF first minister United Ireland They leave all the comments from their supporters warning not to split the unionist vote  If you dont vote DUP youll get a SF first minister They leave nasty comments from supporters about how useless the UUP are MY QUESTION why leave all that negativity but remove my questions and neutral commentary MY SUGGESTED ANSWER I believe it is an extension of their manifesto a campaign built on scaring people to vote for them through fear of what might happen if they dont vote for them I appreciate it is their site and their control but surely this is censorship and control in fact what they are leaving behind is cleverly disguised propaganda Can their members not be trusted to consider other options Is this North Korea If you know of DUP supporters who might like to open their minds please share talk to or encourage because this doesnt seem fair or right to me How do we at least talk to these people and get the debate off the ground  Freedom of Expression NO WAIT  Have just noted that Arlene Foster has also blocked me and my commentaries on her page ALL GONE,477,21,0.0440251572327044

Where is your proof of that your talking nonsense The founding father as you put it was as committed to helping the Roman Catholic community as much as the Protestant I shall be telling my children of how SF murdered more members of its own people than security force members combined I hope youll tell your children of this slaughter and how they are the political arm of a violent Protestant hating terrorist gang of thugs and responsible for the murder of innocent children,84,1,0.011904761904761904
Tony King it says a lot of your mindset that someone critical of the dup must be a supporter of sinn Fein You can in fact feel both were equally wrong There is plenty of evidence in the form of his speeches and news footage He was happy to support catholics in his constituency but the government ensured there was not a level playing field It seems what you will be telling your children is that in was all the other sides fault Did yet ever stop to consider what led to them getting so much support in the first place,101,4,0.039603960396039604
The evidence is there if you look at it whether you want to see it is another story Can you honestly say hand on heart all things considered that the DUP have not been a sectarian organisation since its inception And that they and their policies are inherently divisive and have done absolutely nothing to heal the scars of our society And thats before we even talk about their glaring incompetence and patent inability to govern For the record I will be telling my children that both sides were equally responsible for the terror and murder that took place But that we must move on from that and look forward not back,112,2,0.017857142857142856
Evidence please explain and present such The late Ian Paisley was not a commander of any terrorist group unlike others who openly admit they were and yet refuse to apologise for the murder and terrorising of both Protestants and Roman Catholics and those party leaders that still claim they werent members of a terrorist group When everyone knows full well they are,62,1,0.016129032258064516
If you care to read my original post I alluded to the fact that Ian paisley Snr stirred sectarian hatred and incited violence I did not imply that he was the operating commander of any terrorist group There is incontrovertible evidence of his toxic hate speech and actions as part of the various paramilitary organisations that he formed or was involved with These include the Ulster Protestant Action the Ulster Protestant Volunteers Third force and the Ulster Resistance Do you not know anything about Northern Irish history This is all well documented the speeches pictures and film footage is all available online I will give you a few examples to illustrate my point and you can decide if you still think that he was not responsible for inciting any violence or stirring sectarian tensions I do however suggest that you do a bit more thorough reading about this As part of the UPA he was responsible for naming the addresses of catholic businesses and homes during a rally These were later attacked and burnt out and taigs out painted on their walls He was also involved in campaigning for catholic families to be denied access to social housing He formed the UPV many of whose members were also in the UVF and who attended each others marches and rallies He publicly thanked the UVF for attending a march in 1966 shortly after which they launched an indiscrimate campaign of petrol bombing catholic homes and murdering innocent Catholics In 1968 he roused a rabble of 500 men with cudgels to counter a civil rights march in Armagh He was the main thrust of a workers strike which was aimed at paralysing the whole country for 2 weeks in 1974 in opposition to the sunningdale agreement The strikers targeted fellow protestants who refused to stop working and culminated in loyalists bombing in Dublin and Monaghan killing 33 innocent people He later organised another strike in 1977 boasting that he had personally taken part in the patrols during a speech in Westminster During this strike a loyalist bus driver was murdered for continuing to work and A UDR soldier was killed in a bomb targeted at a petrol station for staying open Need I go on there is a LOT more The point is it stinks of hypocrisy for the DUP to go on saying that we need to teach our children that terrorism was never justified when Paisley himself was responsible for inspiring some of that terrorism You keep going back to mentioning other groups who no doubt were at times equally or more responsible for the wrongs of the past They seem to be trying to move forward More than can be said for the DUP who Just want to keep dragging everyone back into the them and us default setting Its pathetic and embarrassing and anyone who considers voting for them should have a long hard look at themselves and their children and seriously consider if more of the same is really going to help us all move on in peace and harmony,513,12,0.023391812865497075

Who said anything about Sein Fein leading progression Certainly not me For real progression to be made all those with ties in paramilitary groups and unionism shouldnt have control Thats my opinion You dont agree with all the DUP policies So you would rather vote the lesser of 2 evils assuming your proclamation of Sein Feins hand in these scandals of recent Thats a very naive way to vote and I hope for Northern Ireland that your smarter than that,80,9,0.1125

Think its pretty clear that he understands Northern Ireland have a power sharing executive if thats the case then he would rather UUP share power with SDLP instead of Sinn Fein and would rather UUP be the major Unionist party instead of DUP However I must say it is extremely disheartening and extraordinarily sad that so many people believe Unionism is the most important topic when deciding a vote I would recommend people expand their voting options away from GreenOrange and look at parties who have policies with the entirety of Northern Ireland in mind,95,8,0.08421052631578947

The UUP and SDLP both say they want to work together for the good of Northern Ireland How can it be a surprise  or a bad thing  that one might ask voters to transfer lower preferences to the other party Is that not a sign that they might be able to work together in government on the basis of trust and mutual respect,63,2,0.031746031746031744

Ultimately their ideological differences are opposing though SDLP are socialist nationalist and avidly progay marriage if you have ideological commitments surely they take precedence Nationalist parties ultimately all seek to end the government from Belfast to Dublin,37,2,0.05405405405405406
Thats a more reasoned explanation than most but I would add two major points First ideology is one source of motivation accountability is another Moreover as we fully know the largest party will have to share power Surely it could be ideologically rational to prefer a more ideologically cohesive UUPSDLP coalition rather than a much less ideologically cohesive DUPSF one Second this election is not a border poll As far as the prospect of Irish unity is concerned I would politely suggest that the DUPs attitude and performance in government has helped to make it more likely,97,4,0.041237113402061855

Michelle Mclveen has worked hard as agri minister However I would lie to know the Dups policy on agriculture post Brexit Are we to assume that Diane Dodds plea in the EU parliament that the special needs of NI be recognised or are we to accept Nigel Dodds recent assertion that Brexit means Brexit for all the devolved regions A statement on border policy would be useful We have also to remember that during Arlene Fosters tenure as Deti minister she welcomed all eu funding as great opportunities for NI During the referendum there were no grand statements about exiting eu leading me to believe that she was really a remain fan So do the DUP want an open border where the goods and people flow freely or do they want a border where tariffs will apply I as a dairy farmer am interested in this as the time is rapidly approaching when I become a net exporter of raw milk Just curious,163,12,0.0736196319018405
Richard Knox in the European Parliament Diane Dodds was pointing out that it is in everyones interest for a sensible trade deal on agricultural produce following Brexit It is in the EUs interest to secure a deal with the UK as the UK buys more agricultural produce from the EU than we sell to Europe Similarly between NI and the Republic it is in everyones interests for sensible arrangements to be put in place There has been too much scarmongering throughout the process,83,6,0.07228915662650602

Luke Bloomer  I am immensely proud of Northern Ireland I have always respected everyones right to their beliefs in God it is unfair to lay all the blame of everything at the door of the DUP  The Church in general plays a major role in the life of Northern Ireland whether people like that or not My mistrust in other unionist parties came from the treatment they gave to their loyal electorate  of which I was one around the time the GFA was signed That trust Im afraid is lost and will never be regainedno matter how badly the DUP may have treated the MLA you refer to There are no facts about RHI  we voted less than a year ago if the electorate had been very concerned about the issues you mention the other parties would be leading Northern Ireland today,142,8,0.056338028169014086
Joanne I am of the firm belief that the main reason the DUP emerge as the largest party in Northern Ireland is because the DUP engage in scaremongering amongst the unionist electorate vote for DUP or youll get a SF FM  in reality there is no difference between FM  dFM as it is a joint office The DUP capitalise on fear It is such a shame I have friends in England who sometimes talk to me about NI politics  they regularly ask about our socialmoral backwardness their words this makes me embarrassed as no country in the 21st century should be denying marriage equality denying the womans right to choose and the outright and blatant subversion of democracy by way of abuse of PoC So therefore fearful voting is a major contributor to the DUPs success Just my theory,139,11,0.07913669064748201

Luke Bloomer  no you are quite correct the RC church is not in the executive however it plays a major role in the fabric of our society as you very well know Im not an overly religious person and I am definitely not free Presbyterian Is it really likely in a place like NI that it will ever the get past the Church to give more women the choice to abort babies I honestly would doubt it will give in quietly I have enjoyed exchanging views with you but Im going to leave it there now My original post was about the hated spread by people  while you have not lowered yourself to use offensive language you dont care for my opinions  all the best,125,4,0.032

Joanne Walker Defining people by their religion Disappointing A secular Northern Ireland government is what we need Removed from interpretations of the bible that have no relevance to 2017 We have already proved evolution and even sent a man to the moon in 1969 using the application of science We dont need religiosity in Northern Ireland We do not need a party whos origins come from a man who described Catholics Irish Catholics not Roman Catholics as Vermin who breed like rats He changed Hopefully Northern Ireland will also,89,2,0.02247191011235955
Joanne Walker there wouldnt be elections every few months if the FM didnt steal If Sinn Fein had done what Arlene did Im sure you would have a different view of the crime committed Your stances on abortion and gay marriage I will not question  I have realised from literally doing a degree in Philosophy and mostly ethics that theres no debate when morality is justified by faith You couldnt argue with a Muslim that the hijab is wrong and you couldnt argue with a Jew that they shouldnt follow the laws of the Torah No one can argue your moral stance on these positions because in the end all you will bring to the table is it says it in the bible so it must be rightwrong,128,11,0.0859375
Debbie Wilkinson  there ends the argument if Roman Catholics are following their teachings to the letter they cant be in favour of abortion  Many people here of both religions live by the Bible Debbie just as you have rightly pointed out many other religions live by their rule books that may not be fashionable today but true never the less I dont like people making an assumption about me you have no right to suggest how I would feel  until another person mentioned SF in the conversation  I dont think I had You simply have no evidence anything has been stolen and for someone with a degree to make such a remark publicly and without evidence is a bit silly to me,122,2,0.01639344262295082
PPaul MMichael DDuffy  the conversation about religion actually came about because the subject of abortion was brought up by another person in the conversation I am not the religious freak you may think I am and I do believe it or not respect peoples right to worship how they wish  or not as the case may be There is no religion called Irish Catholic and as an Anglican myself in my creed we pray as members believing in the Holy Catholic Church week in week out  so please excuse my need to stress the word Roman I agree with you to a certain degree we do not need religion in our politics unfortunately that has to come from all sections of the community so please spare me your disappointment about a conversation about abortion which ultimately brought the subject of religion into what was a political conversation If you look carefully you will see  I didnt mention Roman Catholics anywhere until that point When the significant majority of both religions here ditch there religion then maybe we will get the Northern Ireland you and people like you want By the way  it was the RC church who denied its people contraception it actively asked women when would they be starting a family and if not why not and although not how I would describe Roman Catholics living in Ireland there was some truth in the thinking of the man who formed the DUP I think you should be able to see now Im not the religious bigot you wish I was All the best,264,7,0.026515151515151516
Reasons to bombard DUP Their stance on marriage equality and LGBT rights Their stance on womens right to choose Their continuous bounce from one scandal to another  NAMA Red Sky RHI to name a few Their inability to separate religion and state Using public money on their antigay agenda Their leaders inability to step aside during a legitimate investigation into allegations of misuse of public funds causing the collapse of our government  thats quite a big one I could go on I really hope everyone who votes along unionist lines chooses another party The DUP have failed,97,8,0.08247422680412371
Rebecca Cairns  sorry I remember well the day I became a DUP voter it had nothing to do with identity or fire brand religion It was because the other unionist party betrayed their voters by accepting an agreement with no proper decommissioning of weapons If you feel the need to go on  please do Up until a few months ago the parties all sat in executive positions  perhaps it would be better to say all the parties have failed As for voting to remain within the uk which is my right  I will vote for the party that I feel will do that better as the other parties have not been able to prove themselves Unfortunately the trust has gone for me with other unionist parties and I would suggest that is the main reason the DUP have lead the country for 10 years Quite well too I might add the change for the good in NI in the past 10 years is truly unbelievably  you only have to look at tourism figures Religion will never be separate from state  until there is no religion what caused the division on the Island and further more what causes turmoil around the world and has done since time began  Religion,208,3,0.014423076923076924

Ian Brown  why the area you speak of is my area too if our MLAs are working for us why do we need to change them I think you will find the Lisburn area is actually pretty evenly spread with 3 DUP 2 UUP and 1 Alliance representative  from recollection the last assembly election the stats were 3 out of 4 DUP voted in 2 out of 2 UUP voted in and 1 out 1 Alliance candidates voted in The others perhaps didnt get in because of lisburn or as it should be Lagan Valley is a unionist stronghold  I doubt much will have changed since last May,108,9,0.08333333333333333
Joanne Walker nobody follows their religious teaching to the letter it is childish and impractical to think that Much like Politicians make claims they are going to do great things but dont always do exactly what they said Im Roman Catholic and I dont agree with abortion I dont condemn women that have them though because everyone has their own life their own circumstances It is typical that a DUP supporter brought religion into this whole discussion rather than keeping to the point of politics,85,5,0.058823529411764705
Actually Lee go back through the conversation I didnt bring religion into it so you are saying as a Roman Catholic you pick and choose what you want to take from your religion I refer back I was challenged about the stand the DUP takes on abortion that was when a political conversation became religious The blame for the stand on abortion and even gay rights etc cannot be laid at the door of the DUP  Read up on your religion and how as recently as last year the RC church vested an interest in a court case around abortion If you cant accept that then Im sorry I agree every circumstance is different as does your church  they also feel that where there is life there is life and no matter how a woman becomes pregnant  its never the babys fault Actually on that I agree with the RC church Please as I say read away back and see once social issues where religion has a vested interest whether you like it or not  politics become religious Typical of a non DUP supporter to see only and believe only what they want to,194,9,0.04639175257731959
Just incase anyone else feels like challenging me about the comments made regarding the RC church and abortion  please refer yourselves to the precious life website There is a very clear message on it from the RC Church and voting with a conscience There ends my need to defend myself regarding a religious denomination I dont belong to but the party I support is ironically clearly in tune with its teachings I suppose as I have always said of both denominations  Its ok to say you are a ProtRC  its totally different to properly live as one or other Its been lovely exchanging views with you all but as its now a long time since the conversation started I wont reply to anymore comments,124,7,0.056451612903225805
Joanne Walker the only problem I have is that you mention the DUP have led this country for 10 years I think youll find that even though the first minister has been a DUP candidate they have no greater power than Deputy First Minister Now that is a fact Therefore your argument that DUP have changed this country for the good as you put it isnt quite true I think youll find that was brought about by a powersharing government and not the sole efforts of DUP Rosetinted glasses or do you not understand the Good Friday Agreement There are certain facts about the RHI scandal that place DUP at the centre of mishandlingdo your research Before you attack though I didnt say these were intentional mishandlings So vote for who you wish but I can understand why people are loosing faith in a party that shown nothing but arrogance and bitterness over the past few months May I use your words with a twist Typical of a DUP supporter to only see and believe what they want to,179,15,0.08379888268156424
We all wear rose tinted glasses here  Im so sorry to everyone that because I support the DUP that Im not the bigot you want me to be The RHI problem was not enough to destabilise the power sharing of the last 10 years especially when we know next to nothing about it  I see things from a unionist perspective others dont and although you can snipe about it being a joint office  you have nothing else to add We all only see what we want to see  as for the GFA I was one of the minority who didnt sign up to it Am I a bigot now because of that  no Im converted Peace converted me and while I have no love for him  I have acknowledged publicly in other discussions that Martin Mc Guinness made an effort Unfortunately I dont see the same wish to embrace my values in the new SF I may have done but unfortunately one very old dinosaur who hasnt moved on is still very much part of the new SF So again  unless you know me which you dont please dont tell me how we got 10 years of relative peace and quiet Arrogance and bitterness  I think it goes without saying all the parties here are guilty of that,218,13,0.05963302752293578

In her speech the other day Arlene Foster mentioned Sinn Fein 24 times with the word equality mentioned only once Likening the party to a crocodile is a great way of showing respect during the lead up to an election Its complete hypocrisy ignoring the mandate for and Irish Language Act that the DUP agreed upon by signing the Saint Andrews Agreement Nelson McCausland stating to Stephen Nolan that the DUP didnt pay attention to the fine print is almost hilarious if it is in fact true If the figures of per year are accurate and not distorted to suit ones own agenda then clearly that is far too much to implement the act in full Though literally burning hundreds of millions of pounds via the RHI scheme due to the naivety and idiocy of the DUP is perfectly acceptable Every party has a responsibility to the entire electorate so to politicise an indigenous language simply to deflect attention from your own failings is not an admirable trait It is point scoring like this rather than actually discussing the real issues is the reason why voters are disillusioned with politics in this country,193,8,0.04145077720207254

Deirdre Macn Really  You want to debate me on the origins of the Irish Gaelic langauge Any of the Bally names and bourgh names are English you know that right Kells and Connor has a Church from 450AD and guess what it never spoke Irish because guess what Ulster as in the Area now of Antrim and Down were never under the control of the Irish until the English came We spoke Ulster Gaelic and then tranferred it to Scotland at the creation of the Dalirada Kingdom in 300ad and wait of it Our high kings of Ulster spoke it Check out the red hand branch at navan fortYep were our Red hand of Ulster really comes from Now take you arrogant Irish extermists beliefs with you woman threatening Ethan friend with ya back to the land you invaded around 300AD and calimed as yours The now Republic of Ireland PS maybe ask you Hibernian friends were they came from and what language they really spoke lmfao,167,17,0.10179640718562874

The SF decision to collapse the Assembly was timed to coincide with the Brexit agenda  They chose their time to coincide with MM departure due to serious illness They were facilitated by the Debacle of the heating scheme which was approved by all parties as it passed through the system but which Nolan and the BBC have used to demonise the DUP The plan is to make Brexit difficult by promoting the view that the majority in Ireland are opposed to Brexit and create as much mileage as possible for their long term goal of a United IrelandUnionists should vote for those representatives who have served them so well at constituency level and frustrated SF attempts to rewrite tHe history of the troubles Unionists should get out and vote for Arlene Foster as the best person to lead Unionism and ensure that Northern Ireland remains firmly in the UK as the benefits of Brexit bring increased prosperity The EU will disintegrate and I hope that the republic could be persuaded to join a social political and economic federation of the isles,181,9,0.049723756906077346

Ian Paisley incited a religious War in which Protestants shamefully wanted power and dominance  Even Gusty Spence said it was 50 years of Protestant misrule Catholics wanted equality  and then it became a battle for independence form Britain  but for the legacy and healing to happen it is important that NI Unionism takes responsibility for starting the conflict in the first place by illegally discriminating against Catholics on the basis of religion  catholics were then right to kick start the Civil Rights campaign and once again Paisley objected to that too he dint want equality for Catholics How can that be justified,102,1,0.00980392156862745

So Alliance are about compromise shared values and working to find what is best for everyone by not being entrenched in the same old sectarian head count sounds like a vote for them is exactly what NI needs to break this deadlock,42,0,0.0
I dont agree I think Alliance cant work out if they are Arthur or Martha Theres absolutely no way of getting away from the fact we live in a divided country and trying to throw people together who dont want to be together wont workWe need leaders who can speak out for their people without demeaning the other side not leaders who live in cloud cuckoo land,67,4,0.05970149253731343
Sorry my last post isnt really saying what Im trying to get across I will try to be more articulateAlliance say they want to and can unite us all But  The main issue here is the border If Alliance want to remain British then they are Loyal to the crown and so they should be classed as loyalists If they support a United Ireland then they are actually republicansHow do they propose to make both sides happy with that  Or are they planning to do what Ive accused SF off and try to make Ulster so Irish the nationalists will be ok with living under the union flag  Because that wont be excepted by the loyalistsPeople talk about the Orange and green vote as if its a terrible thing But I dont see it that way I see it as people being true to what they believe is right for them The biggest problem I see here is we have too many unionist parties Surely if we are all loyalists fighting for right to stay British  which is the real difference between the two sides then we dont need so many parties  Now the nationalists are starting to get more parties I would have thought they would have learned by our mistake but obviously not  I believe a vote for Alliance is a vote for cowards and dithererspeople who dont want to be seen as sectarian who will give up what they truly want and just hope it works out ok,251,12,0.04780876494023904
Says who  If your a loyal British citizen your a loyalist If you support a republic your a republican And I would be ashamed of any unionist who didnt class them as loyalist Whats so wrong with saying it as it is  Again and again we have this nonsense of people being afraid or ashamed to say exactly where they stand What in gods name is wrong with declaring your a loyalist And whats extreme about it  Please explain,79,3,0.0379746835443038
How dare you assume Im ANY kind of extremist I most certainly am not But I am a realist  And the majority of people in this country do want to live in peace together but they still mostly stand by one flag or the other And until our leaders wise up and accept thats not going to change we cannot solve our problems And also I am past caring about ALL the dirty deals our leaders are into but I am interested in knowing what is being done to take the two communities forward on the same path You very obviously cant answer my questions so retort to childish accusations I would hope there is someone from DUP and Alliance who do have some answers You see I live very harmoniously in a mixed area and I am from a very mixed family But I am loyal to the crown and will not ever downplay my loyalty for anyoneunlike these so called unionists you say you know who wouldnt want to be called a loyalist Facts are facts  The politics in this wee country are orange and green British and Irish and if the dolly daydreamers can admit this and try to find a way to keep both sides happy its never going to be any different All I want is Honesty,222,5,0.02252252252252252
Also you have assumed I dont know the difference in the references loyalist and unionist and nationalist and republican My point is there is no difference But you havent told me if the Alliance party are For a United Ireland or Britain  If you dont know please dont feel embarrassed Just say you dont know But dont try and fob me off with the RHI scheme etc after all if you sit with murderers and terrorists youve no room to condemn anyone,82,9,0.10975609756097561

Your obviously not reading properly Or your not getting the gist of what Im saying In an ideal ni we would all live harmoniously together But there is still too much pain and mistrust for that yet But even if we had that halcyon country it would still need to come under British or Irish rule and I want to know which one Alliance is for  I already know where the parties stand but I am not sure about Alliance  Believe me no matter how much we can live together work together live together we still in the huge majority of cases have an alliegience to either Britain or Ireland,110,3,0.02727272727272727
Your wasting my time You wont answer my question Your not getting it at all No matter what goes on here be it corruption by each side or poor health services or people living on the streets it WONT matter to the majority of voters when it comes to choose Look at the last election for example Everyone including the DUP if they are honest expected them to take a hammering But it didnt happen All Im asking is how are Alliance going to change whats happening How are Alliance going to convince me to vote for them  How will they take the fear and mistrust away from loyalists  unionists and nationalists  republicans and convince them they would be better off just trusting that Alliance will turn us from fervently caring about our identity to being these little stepford wives types who all want the same thing  I want to vote for someone who lives in the real world Yes we want peace yes we want a government where theres no corruption but lets face it what country people n the world doesnt  How many countries have it  None  I have voted DUP since theyve been around But Im so fed up so let down by the rolling over and playing dead to SF I really want an alternative But what I want doesnt exist in our country I want a party that says We have to share power with SFIRA but we have the PUL communities back  We will Keep Ulster British We will give the nationalists  republicans  the right to call themselves Irish but we will not give them an Irish Ulster Ive said over and over that the people in this my wee country are the only ones who care about it Both sides Love this country If they didnt the loyalists would move to the mainland and the nationalists  republicans would move to Ireland But the mistrust is enormous and thats the reason no matter how much we crave change we wont get it Because neither side trusts the other to vote for it I wanted to know what in this country is the most important question which country is Alliance loyal too  Britain or Ireland Thats all But instead your going on about corruption Which by the way your accusing people off without waiting for the outcome of the inquiry which to give her her dues Mrs Foster has welcomed So either tell me how Alliance are going to bring the two communities together and how that would work in a power sharing government Or admit you dont know Id love a viable alternative but can I just say Id never vote Alliance with Naomi Long as their leader anyway Shes a loud vulger person who avoids issues and comes across as someone who just wants to rule for the greater good of Naomi long,480,20,0.041666666666666664
Its not a time delay I have an illness and suffer severe fatigue I have been asleep of and on all day Sorry if you feel Im being over critical but I just want a party that can stand up for me We have to share power with nationalists  republicans who dont want us to breathe the same air as them So I want a party that says We have your back Not a party that says we will make nationalists lesser beings than us who dont matter Just a party that says we wont bow down to having our culture destroyed and we wont dismiss the the thousands murdered and maimed by IRA just so we can be in power It upsets me that you dont care whether we are British or Irish That means you are willing to throw the thousands who have sacrificed their lives for us under the busbut thats your choice Personally I am a proud British citizen who admires and supports our armed forces Who still stands for the queen and who would prefer to be ANY nationality other than Irish I have no allegiance to Ireland or anything Irish I would love Trump to build his wall around OUR border without any entrance or exit But that doesnt make me sectarian It has nothing to do with religion but about identity and security,230,7,0.030434782608695653
One thing Im not is paranoid the other thing Im not is sectarian I am proud to be British and I dont believe in dual Irish British nationality Neither am I so selfish as to only care about what happens in my country in my lifetimeyes government are to blame for a lot of wrongs But you dont stop supporting something just because they dont do everything your way  Youve answered my question anyway Alliance are not bothered whether we are under British or Irish ruleso basically its just Power they want and not whats good for the people of my countryi hope that people have the good sense not to waste a vote on them Thank you Enjoy your flight Safe home,123,10,0.08130081300813008

Lets face the reality Move on to what Warren  A new beginning with who  We simply dont have what it takes for a new beginning We dont have the caliber and the mechanism to form any kind of ruling party in Northern Ireland We tried it with NI 21 and some very right minded people who had vision And what happened two former Unionist fools destroyed it before it ever got off the ground And during the election did the people vote for them No they voted again for sectarian politics which has left us in the mess we are now in Sinn Fein really do not have the interest of the Northern Irish people at heart and are out to rule Ireland as a republican identity I feel sorry for some members of the DUP who are very hard working people and who genuinely look after their local constituents But covering up the scandals now upon us leaves a lot to be desired They all now cant make any excuses they have failed and why have they failed Because if the truth is to be told they really dont like each other as Sinn Fein are not prepared to rule NI with the DUP as a separate identity from the rest of Ireland This leaves the terrorist to carry out their evil deed in the months and years ahead,230,10,0.043478260869565216

David Long nothing to do with religion or political aims If Sinn Fein could put forward a politician who supported the goal of a UI and the political objectives of SF but wasnt connected by blood to those who had the Armalite in one bloody hand Then perhaps Unionists would stop refering to them as the political wing of the IRA and would in time see them as a purely political opponent But SF are eithet unable or un wiling to put up people who have a genuine distance from those involved in violence Surely its not too difficult for them to reach out in such a manner,108,8,0.07407407407407407
Bottom line is we dont want terrorist sympathisers in government and we want to remain British because the antiquated idea of Irish nationalism has no basis in pragmatism I respect British democracy and I want every facet of Northern Irish demography represented in government Islamic Jewish Roman Catholic and otherwise In most western democracies Sinnfein would have been decimated long ago most of their members locked up for life on charges of terror As in 1916 when Irish republicans saw fit to murder people for a fun little cause while their kin died in France even now a century later their pointless agenda does nothing but obstruct the proper governance of this state,113,2,0.017699115044247787

If everybody benefited i cant see how and why my point is plainly sectarian is there no sinn fein farmers that used this scheme but said nothing As you said urself the majority were protestants so the minority were catholics Why did they not complain about the scheme by the way ive no love for the DUP  i just want to know why it was covered up for so long,70,8,0.11428571428571428

Whats a Sinn Fein farmer Nothing has been published detailing who is benefitting from this scheme but thats irrelevant If I could have benefited from it I absolutely would have and theres no way in hell Im going to be doing anything to put that at risk by talking about it either What youre trying to do here Ray and its not surprising that you are is desperately find a way to implicate the Fenians in this because its all you know how to do It doesnt matter how long you spend rolling around the marbles youre not going to come to any conclusions which will change the fact this is the fault of the DUP,116,12,0.10344827586206896
I agree it was the fault of the DUP but i wud like to know who all benefited from it  Did you did i i certainly didnt but i wud love to know why it being outed now just as martin is on his way out Why has nothing been published detailing who benefited from the scheme as soecially as it was left open an extra 2 weeks to let  more DUP  benefit from it,75,10,0.13333333333333333
Exactly jackie i dont think that the ordinary man in the street benefited from the scheme But i think its a reasonable question to ask was it inly the DUP that benefited or did sinn fein the gren party the UUP  the TUV  the SDLP and the Alliance parties,49,11,0.22448979591836735
There will have been genuine adopters to this scheme who didnt abuse it or signed up to it in good faith Others will have outlayed a lot of money on installing a pellet burner The point is these individuals are not the minority who abused the scheme and therefore dont deserve to be vilified Furthermore they didnt set the terms of the scheme DETI did While it may be easy to point the finger at the folks genuine or not who signed up to the scheme the fault lies with the implementors of the scheme,95,6,0.06315789473684211

Yep no problem Mark As Environment Minister she rejected multiple calls following a public consultation to implement an independent environmental protection agency Later the Mills review highlighted the systemic failure in the then DOE and the million cleanup cost that we could be faced with in dealing with illegal waste dumping When she was Enterprise Trade and Investment Minister we lost a billion offshore wind farm project for Northern Ireland that would have been the largest in the whole of the UK And now the RHI scheme where we could be losing up to million due to her sheer incompetence Any questions,102,3,0.029411764705882353
If youre referring to instances of illegal waste dumping which has a detrimental impact on the environment wildlife and public health across this Country I dont see how you can come to the conclusion that this is a bad thing for a government to have to tackle The EU has quite rightly stepped in where our government has failed in protecting its own citizens we owe a huge debt of thanks to the EU for providing this oversight And the windfarm project would have brought significant jobs and investment to Northern Ireland but Foster refused to engage because she is an incompetent minister thats really all you need to know,110,4,0.03636363636363636

Yes Kerstin in a civilised Christian society free and fair elections are how we establish governments that is a great privilege many in this world dont enjoy But with privilege comes responsibility and that is the duty to accept the result in a peaceful and civil way Sinn Fein still struggle with that concept and are bringing down the government because they are not getting their way Its nothing to do with money or the waste of money after all that is their speciality If there is an election we will be in a very similar situation to before nothing will have changed except that the cost of the election will have been wasted and we will be ruled by Westminster where the DUPs substantial block of MPs hold a lot of sway then Sinn Fein will find they have thrown all the toys out of the pram and they have no more to throw,155,7,0.04516129032258064

Agreed however my comment was in relation to this particular email,11,0,0.0
What exactly is the problems she is supposed to be whishle blowing about This is total nonsence There is no real crisis only a manufactured perception of a crisis Somehow an allegation of a cost to the tax payer over 20 years of billion has now decreased to it appears million The media like to round this up now to million over 20 years Indications are this is grossly exagerated and does not take account of agreed spending to create green energy I disagree with the green energy spending Will those now criticising this scheme now join with me in calling for an end into other green energy spending nonsence at the expense of the citizens and tax payers,119,4,0.03361344537815126
You appear to have a poor grasp of the situation The department thought Westminster was covering the bill  it wasnt Its a figure of 485 million which only accounts for the last 9 week period when the department realised it had screwed up and was wrapping it up The billion is the total cost of the scheme which the media hasnt commented on even though this is still a part of the whole cock up This is not manufactured these are real figures But maybe you think 485 million isnt worth caring about,93,3,0.03225806451612903
Matthew Ogilby No I do understand and I agree with you in the most part This money is being spent like a lot of other schemes in the misconception that it will stop Man made climate change I do not agre with spending the other money you mentioned but that was not a mistake only policy  wrong in my opinion The additional millions they are now talking about million per year for the next 20 years It is not yet spent and if those utilising the scheme are found to be misusing it in breach of contract a lot of it wont be spent As you say this is the real issue What I was addressing is the allegation that a person who sent the email had brought this to Arlenes attention She conceeded herself today the email does not do that and she further agreed Arlene was not present at any meetings she then had with civil servants The question in this regard is when did elected ministers actually know,171,4,0.023391812865497075

Most people are not aware of the facts stated below therefore I am sharing this with all of you Here is something to think about and why so many Americans support Donald Trump  This information has all been checked then double checked it is 100 Correct Thats why there is such an alarm within US government since Trumps statement about temporary suspension of migration of Muslims to US till US authorities make sure there is a proper concept of safe penetration of US territory People are stunned to learn that the head of the US CIA is a Muslim Do hope this wakes up some You mean until it hits you like a ton of bricks read it again until you understand We now have a Muslim government John Brennan current head of the CIA converted to Islam while stationed in Saudi Arabia Obamas top adviser Valerie Jarrett is a Muslim who was born in Iran where her parents still live Hillary Clintons top adviser Huma Abedin is a Muslim whose mother and brother are involved in the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt Assistant Secretary for Policy Development for Homeland Security Arif Aikhan is a Muslim Homeland Security Adviser Mohammed Elibiary is a Muslim Obama adviser and founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council Salam alMarayati is a Muslim Obamas Sharia Czar Imam Mohamed Magid of the Islamic Society of North America is a Muslim Advisory Council on FaithBased Neighborhood Partnerships Eboo Patel is a Muslim 11315 Nancy Pelosi announced she will appoint Rep Andre Carson DInd as the first Muslim lawmaker on the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence It would make Carson the first Muslim to serve on the committee that receives intelligence on the threat of Islamic militants in the Middle East He has suggested that US schools should be modeled after Islamic madrassas where education is based on the Quran And last but not least our closet Muslim himself Barack Hussein Obama Its questionable if Obama ever officially took the oath of office when he was sworn in He didnt repeat the oath properly to defend ournation and our Constitution Later the Democrats claimed he was given the oath again in private CIA director John Brennan took his oath on a copy of the Constitution not a Bible Valarie Jarret wrote her college thesis on how she wanted to change America into a Muslim friendly nation and she is a Obama top advisor Congressman Keith Ellison took his oath on a copy of the Quran Congresswoman Michele Bachman was vilified and verbally tarred and feathered by Democrats when she voiced her concern about Muslims taking over our government Considering all these appointments it would explain why Obama and his minions are systematically destroying our nation supporting radical Muslim groups worldwide opening our southern border and turning a blind eye to the genocide being perpetrated on Christians all over Africa and the Middle East The more damage Obama does the more arrogant hes become Our nation and our government has been infiltrated by people who want to destroy us It can only get worse If you fail to pass this one on theres something wrong Somewhere In his book he said if it comes down to it I would side with the Muslims And still some insist he isnt Muslim Common sense doesnt grow in everyones garden,563,40,0.07104795737122557

Dear Britains we love you and dont want to miss in Europe We cant believe that most of you want to quit the EU and we look at the result of your referendum 17 millions voted  but 65 millions live in GB and I think about 40 millions were entitled to vote So I dont see a majority for the exit But I see a responsibility of the parliament to protect all people from harm thats your elementary task Its not easy to find out the folks democratic requests But in severe and farreaching decisions you have to recognize the real needs and not to follow particulate moods that find a majority for the moment A democratic ruled country is reigned by parliament not by moods Therefore here in Germany important decisions need 66 of approval eg Constitutional amendments Im sure everyone of you knows whats the best for his country and will decide in this sense Best wishes and good luck A real anglophile friend,166,9,0.05421686746987952

The DUP has got to be the thickest bunch of all Northern Ireland is by far the most heavily subsidised state in Western Europe  most of this funding coming from the EU either directly or indirectly via London With the UK out of Europe all of this funding will dry up The new Tory Cabinet of ultra market capitalists will sell NI down the river in a heartbeat despite all the waving of the Union Jack and singing of God save the Queen  NI will be left with no option but to look for closer integration with us down south,100,1,0.01
Yeah Arlene afraid youre gonna have to take a leaf out of Camerons book and resign The majority in NI disagree with you and youve sided with the likes of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage Your parties lies and campaigning to leave have helped surely send the country into at the very least uncertain and dangerous times I have seen countless DUP banners with that lets spend it on the NHS slogan and that turned out to be a complete wonder spoof and lets face it its not like you would have had much say in where that money was going anyway Bye bye Arlene you wont be missed,109,6,0.05504587155963303

Well spoken Nigel dodds,4,1,0.25
Brexit  why leave You want to decide for yourself you want to be free But you can not be 100  free in EU EU is taking away your and Britains sovereignty Almost all power is shifted from Britain to EU and away from you You pay taxes to the state and the Bristish state pays billions of pounds to EU and receives back a very very small fraction of that EU uses your and Britains money to give to other countries like Romania Bulgaria and Greece You pay for road works in Greece EU is also for bringing in refugees in millions to the European continent and most of these people will not get jobs in that partical country in Europe that they come to and they will not be a part of the normal life in Europe Most of them will not pay taxes because they will not get jobs the will live in slumareas in Europe also Britain That is not good for Europe The immigration from outside of Europe and also within the EU is not beneficial for Europe and Britain The british society have a big unemployment figure and Britain needs all the jobs we can get As it is now thousands and thousand of people from EU is coming to Britain to work Nothing wrong with that you might think but it is a problem these migrants take jobs that could have gone to the british unemployed people EU itself is a big big industri of politicians you might call it Thousand of politicians and administrationworkers make a lot of money in EU and the parlament of EU and all the offices around there cost a fortune for the countries of EU inkluding Britain The economics of EU has been a disaster To be out of EU therefor better than being in If Britain leaves EU Britain can easily trade with the EUcountries and countries outside EU Because of all this  because of all the problems with EU  Britain is now voting about its future Britain should decide on their own politics  not EU It is therefor very important that we vote to Leave EU,360,15,0.041666666666666664
For me to vote Brexit perhaps the DUP could answer some fundamental questions regarding what foreign nationals are really bringing to our country 1 How many foreigner nationals are in our prison system and at what cost 2 How many hours of police time are taken up with arrests and court appearances of foreign nations and what is that costing our country 3 How much is the legal aid bill for court appearances solicitors and the interrupters which the EU says they are entitled to have 4 Why when a FN commits a crime no matter how big are small in this counrty are they not put on a plane cheaper alternative to putting them through our court system and sent back to their own country with an enforcement order that states they are not allowed back 5 How many babies have been born to foreign nations in Northern Ireland alone over the last 10 years putting strain on our already over stretched hospital services 6 How many diseases which were mainly erdicated in the UK have returned to our shores with the rise of immigration such as TB 7 How many foreign nationals are claiming family allowance for children not in this country 8 How many FN children are in our schools putting pressure on our once proud and strong education system 9How many foreign nations are on our hospital waiting lists 10 How many FN have registered with our doctors surgeries in the last 10 yrs meaning we now have longer waiting times 11 How much is the annual bill for interrupers for FN 12 How many foreign nationals are receiving DLA and support packages for disablities in NI 13 How many FN are claiming benefits as single parents and are getting the full range of benefits such as housing benefit and rates relief 14Because whole areas such as Dungannon have large numbers of FN where whole housing estates have been taken over by them how much less is a property now worth in these areas 15A Research and Information Service Paper for the Northern Ireland Assemble stated Almost 122000 long term international migrants are estimated to have arrived in Northern Ireland between 2000 and 2010 researchers now believe that in the last 6 years this figure has doubled putting huge econmic stress on our communities Why is this being allowed in a country of just over 2 million people I could go on but if you can answer these questions it may help to give a clearer indication of how much Free movement of people in the EU is really costing us and why we should vote out,441,17,0.03854875283446712

Brexit The young the educated the Londoners the Scots the Welsh the Northern Irish the Irish Cypriots and Maltese must vote to remain If Britain chooses to withdraw from the European Union it will bring to an end a tempestuous relationship between the individualist leaning Brits and more Communatarian rest of the continent Within Britain it is clear that strong majorities exist for remaining in the EU in Scotland and in Northern Ireland and to a lesser extent in Wales Digging deeper London wishes strongly to remain and the rest of England slightly to strongly negative Poor little England What is astonishing is that in England those regions that are least affected by the migration which is portrayed as the catalyst of this crisis are the most vehement in their refusal to consider reasoned argument on the subject London a vibrant and international city full of migrants is the most positive part of England in favour of remaining in Europe Despite the 2011 census showing its ethnic makeup is less than 45 British which includes Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland far from feeling threatened by diversity the English capital clearly does not share UKIPs view that England would be better off out This most densely populated part of England does not feel there is a lack of space or jobs and does not see its culture threatened by migrants Comparing the capital to the rural counties from where distressing reports of the abuse of migrant workers emerge regularly we already have a feeling that the contradictory views and behaviour of the leaveshires lack morality whichever way we look at them The antics of Boris Johnson who has with great energy to give him his due taken over from the political fringe occupied by the failed UKIP party in flying the Leave flag and are an embarrasment The unavoidable comparisons with the other blonde moptop go deeper than dodgy hair styles While Trump is out to buy the US presidency with money and barely disguised gungho racism Johnson having lost his position as Mayor of London clearly sees an opportunity in the Leave campaign to challenge for ladership of the Tory party and a path to being Prime Minister That alone should be enough to ring alarm bells regarding his judgement of whats best for Britain The narrow education that is typical in English schools where the majority of young people do not learn a foreign language or economics or geography or history to the A levels creates a fertile ground for those who wish to spread untruth myths and outrageous lies about the European project It is imperfect So is the British take on democracy But it has delivered peace growth freedom of movement and human rights It is has had a mondernising and positive influence on every country it has touched Yes there are differences of approach and views and yes it sometimes takes years to arrive at less than perfect compromises But it does achiecve that where otherwise there would be nothing If the UK drops out of Europe where will the Foreign Direct Investment to Britain go We can expect a certain amount to go there regardless but a large part of that investment is prdicated on the UK providing access to the EU market with tarifs or trade barriers It is also predicated on the current situation where the pound does not swing wildly relative to the Euro Ireland and the Netherlands seem likely targets for companies As the OECD reports httpwwwoecdorgdafinvinvestmentpolicyFDIinFiguresApril2016pdf OECD FDI inflows almost doubled compared to 2014 most ly due to large inflows in Ireland the Netherlands  Switzerland and the United States  Investors from those countries were also responsible for the 35  increase in OECD outflows These countries appear among the top destinations and top sources of FDI worldwide in 2015 It cannot be a good thing for the UK to become less attractive as a destination for investment just as it chooses to go it alone And thats the nub of it If Britain votes to leave the EU they will be alone Remaining a member of NATO will not keep people in jobs or ensure British exports have free access to the single biggest market in the world Everyone whos opinion is based on science rather than emotion agrees from UK based business leaders politicans from all parties except UKIP and the DUP trade unions economic forecasters and academics The wider worlds most respected and influential economic organisations and leaders are of one voice  to leave would be anything from foolish to disastrous Even President Obama whos office would not usually pronounce on such sovereign discussions has made clear that this would damage the UKs position with the US In fact internationally the US mophead Trump appears to be Johnsons only ally there How long before he suggests that he will flood the Channel Tunnel and make the French pay for it Even the citizens of Europe are in every other EU country positive they want the UK to remain Johnsons charge that there is a democratic void in Europe is worth discussing but so to is the faulty democracry present in many EU states the UK included where winning as little as 38 of the vote can lead to overwhelming majorities in our nations parliaments That is a subject for another day For now let us hope that the young the educated the Londoners the Scots the Welsh the Northern Irish the Irish Cypriots and Maltese in Britain all come out in vast numbers because they are the ones who can ensure a positive result for Britain for Ireland and for Europe  a continent united If you know anyone with a vote  encourage them to vote to remain Anything else would be very bad for the UK TDH,968,35,0.03615702479338843
I think its obvious why the DUP favours exit it strengthens the principle of existence of the border In England the Outers have their own agenda The DUP should be careful they get what they wish for as a constitutional can of worms will be unwrapped potentially bringing into question the role of the the Crown and Scotland in the union Then it will be just a matter of time before Northern Ireland is allowed to go,77,2,0.025974025974025976
1 The EU is not a sovereign entity It has only the powers that we give it 2 Westminster is the supreme law making authority in this country 3 In cases where EU law is given priority over domestic law in our courts it is only because the UK parliament has expressly instructed them to do so in our own legislation 4 Membership of the EU entails certain obligations but it also offers the opportunity to influence decision making on the world stage 5 The UK has enormous influence within the EU It is not something that happens TO us We are major players In practice nothing happens within the EU to which we are not party 6 We have two years to sever ties with the EU in the event of an exit win But future relations with the EU is a separate thing in terms of things like trade travel and legal agreements EU legal experts say typically it takes at least ten years just to get to a basic agreement 7 The Norwegian Model of EU market membership without EU membership is not necessarily available to us Even if it is it is very expensive We will have a huge number of rules to follow without any ability to influence what those rules are 8 It is completely beyond doubt that a vote to leave the EU we will terminate ALL trade agreements with countries outwith the EU as those were negotiated via the EU This will entail renegotiating around 70 trade agreements 9 Several countries have said they do not want to negotiate a new trade agreement with the UK until they know the terms of our new trade agreement with the EU The one that will take an estimated ten years This is the official public position of the USA and China,307,1,0.003257328990228013
