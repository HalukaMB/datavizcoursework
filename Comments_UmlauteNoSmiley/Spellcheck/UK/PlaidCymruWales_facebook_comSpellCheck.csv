Welsh Scottish English and Irish education system under pressure due to the everlasting Tory austerity measures which are still in place to this day Best thing though is the Tories promised to get our debt down but instead it has rocketed out in to space Pity they couldnt keep to there promises Austerity only affects the less well off in society,61,1,0.01639344262295082
Ieaun Buckley so austerity is wrong and increasing debt is wrong,11,1,0.09090909090909091
Yes utterly wrong totally wrong its not working how long do they intend to keep it in force the next 10 years 20 years mr osbourne and Cameron said in 2010 they would clear the debt and surprise surprise its actually gone in to another solar system So yes its blatantly wrong austerity actually only benefits the rich or well off,61,2,0.03278688524590164
Too much pressure on teachers to the point where the amount of paperwork is taking up the time of actual teaching One of the other problems is the bad behaviour and disruption in the classroom this is affecting learning,39,0,0.0
Ieaun Buckley any one who believed and voting for a party for the policy of clearing 14 trillion debt with a 150 billion deficit in such a short time need to be shot and put out of their suffering,39,1,0.02564102564102564
Well simon more than half of the country should be shot because thats exactly what they did And George and mr Cameron failed spectacularly to clear it And who is suffering years later oh Yes the ordinary working man and women And what about George and david they are still busy fleecing the country,54,3,0.05555555555555555
Not just teachers in Wales but the whole UK Teachers are leaving in droves as are doctors and nurses The pressure and expectations are just too much,27,0,0.0
Ieaun Buckley far less than half the country voted for tories probably less than 20 Have you been round the country and asked every one of them which policy made them vote tory I think most people who voted tory knew that was impossible just like most SNP policies and those of all the other parties,56,5,0.08928571428571429
Simon they were just 20 votes short of an overall majority in 2010 Simon Is it not parties pledges to people to get them to vote for them They plaster billboards they flood the press with there media sympathisers to get there policies cross and like I said simon why have we got austerity measures imposed on us,58,0,0.0

Think you could repeat these statistics for most occupations Many people have jobs on less money less job security worse benefits and the same if not higher levels of stress,30,0,0.0
Id tend to disagree Ive seen first hand the level of stress that the job puts on teachers and the impact that stress has on their lives Im not saying that other jobs arent stressful but disregarding this issue because other jobs are stressful isnt the way to solve the problem really is it,54,4,0.07407407407407407
Why only highlight stress of teachers Ive seen stressed teachers and stressed construction workers,14,1,0.07142857142857142
They dont Theyve also highlighted those working in the health care profession It just so happens that this post is about teachers This isnt an us and them issue But when it gets to the point that good teachers are considering leaving the profession in their droves and yes it is happening then the point has to be addressed When theres a shortage of good construction workers maybe therell be a post dedicated to them But until that point lets keep things on topic,84,5,0.05952380952380952
There is a shortage of good construction workers  although was just using construction workers as an example,17,0,0.0
Well maybe tomorrow therell be an article on them ,9,1,0.1111111111111111
But without good teachers from infant level onwards therell be a knock on effect to all other industries no doubt Education of whatever kind is vital no matter what industry you end up going into,35,1,0.02857142857142857
And without construction workers there would be no schools Without teaching assistants teachers work levels would increase Without drivers nothing would get delivered We could do this all day I absolutely sympathise with teachers and the stress I have a very good insight into this they are under but dont understand why they are put on a pedestal,58,1,0.017241379310344827
And like I said simon how long have we to wait 10 or 15 years its plain to see after 7 years its not working The only thing thats working is the emergency services Ie paramedics construction workers and many many more low paid workers are getting screwed into the ground by there policies Why dont they start a massive council house building project and build thousands of houses for a start that is so desperately needed look at the number of people that would employ who then would spend there earned cash in there local communities,97,3,0.030927835051546393

Dont need no one to wipe my arse can do that myself Simon you mention people lying about on the dole doing nothing constantly so wouldnt it be a great idea to have a massive council house building programme that would get many people employed and contributing to the system and spending there money in local shops and businesses,59,3,0.05084745762711865
Owe aye what money the money this shite selfish government will not spend But will fleece away in there offshore accounts to the tune of millions and millions and there big business buddies like costa coffee amazon Starbucks and the rest of the Tory backing companies who have and get away with all sorts of things on a huge scale Austerity doesnt effect them only the working class,68,4,0.058823529411764705

two broken children who wanted to become teachers but spent too much time being government form fillers would disagree with you Graham Earp Time spent teaching is great but everything else is rotten Classrooms falling to bits holidays spent marking planning and designing courses weekends not your own  nope no nights and no domestic violence but stresful as hell,59,2,0.03389830508474576

Really none of this should be contraversial 1 Wales has been very successful in exporting to the EU Leaving the single market or customs union will make these exports more difficult with no defined benefit The alleged benefit that Britain would have more power to negotiate trade deals with other countries outside the EU is risky and uncertain This isnt the same as remaining in the EU EFTA countries have forms of this without being subject to the ECJ they have their own courts of arbitration I believe just like for any international trade agreements 2 EU citizens who have already come to Wales to work and contribute to our economy should have their rights honoured So should Britons in the rest of the EU but its unethical to make the former contingent on the latter 3 Wasnt this promised by the leave campaigners some of whom are now in government 4 Powers currently at the EU level that relate to devolved matters belong in the Bay not in Westminster when they are brought back into UK laws We dont want to spend time and money in the Supreme Court reversing improper clawbacks by Westminster 5 The deal will involve devolved areas Were supposed to be 4 cooperating nations forming one people now no longer some quasicolonialist unitary state So all 4 parliamentsassemblies should have a say,227,9,0.039647577092511016

The facts as they stand are Wales doesnt have any of the economic leavers that Scotland has We are bombarded with demands for a referendum for every new power going to Cardiff from London and the assemblies decisions are constantly challenged in the London courts I dont believe we are ready for Independence but I do believe that without the necessary tools we cannot in fact balance the books This reduces us to sitting and listening to the constant shrieking of YOU DONT STAND A CHANCE ON YOUR OWN The reality is if you examine that statement that something needs to change Every part of the UK should be able to pay its way Wales supported the UK when we were the coal and steel capital of the world Now that is over we need to rebuild our industry and re build our economic base That can only be done through rebuilding the country London isnt interested so Cardiff should get more power,163,4,0.024539877300613498

John you are clearly not aware of the inaccuracy of your postings Wales in not a member of the UK never has been and never will be For your information the UK is the 1801 union of GB England and Scotland and Ireland When the Republic of Ireland withdrew from the union in 1923 the UK ceased to exist In 1927 Westminster in its wisdom added N Ireland to GB England and Scotland recreating a new UK Wales was again left out of the union Wales could become self sufficient more so than N Ireland and Scotland,97,0,0.0

The point being here is that we have it drummed into us that Wales could never survive on its own and at the moment that is true but aspiration can get you anywhere There are smaller countries than Wales that can manage perefctly fine we need to stop accepting Labour as the party of Wales They are puppets controlled by a Westminster party We keep voting for them and nothing changes People need more confidence in Wales we are not second class to anyone else We are the first and last colonial possesion of England It is drummed into us that we rely on them and we cant afford to be independnt or we would never survive All scaremongering tactics The UK should at least be federal at a bare minimum Its not about xenophobia towards other people its the pride and passion to believe we can do this Welsh decisions made in Wales And if we get it wrong we have ourselves to hold to account If we voted as a majority out of the EU what makes a union with England any better As Leanne Wood says anyone who wants to be Welsh can be Welsh but who the hell trusts a Tory government to deliver for Wales,210,4,0.01904761904761905

Politically Great Britain refers to the whole of England Scotland and Wales in combination but not Northern Ireland as to include Northern Ireland it then becomes the United Kingdom it includes islands such as the Isle of Wight Anglesey the Isles of Scilly the Hebrides and the island groups of Orkney and Shetland that are part of England Wales or Scotland It does not include the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands which are selfgoverning dependent territories So there are already Self Governing Territories in the UK So why the arguments against Wales or Scotland becoming self governing What do we have that they wont let us go,109,1,0.009174311926605505

Well Stephen those of us who voted to remain and keep as they say harping on about it are told to put it all behind us because Brexit is going forward So perhaps that is what you may be able to do Put it behind you and look to the future with a Party that has the interests of Wales at its heart It has already been stated by the government at Westminster that Wales will more or less be pushed on to the side lines What is new Labour hasnt done anything for a century in Wales The Torys as I have already said The Lib Dems Who UkIP yes well So the only Party that will work for the best deal post Brexit is Plaid So please like I am told put the Referendum behind you and vote for the future Vote Plaid,145,6,0.041379310344827586
Not sure if I can mucka to many harsh words said about the voters the one thing I liked about Plaid was they said their not like mainstream parties taking voters for granted calling a remainer a winger or hanging on to less hope is different from racist xenophobic or dont know what they voted for as if were thick that takes a lot to put behind people if people turn up on my doorstep and apologise for comments like that I could find a way to change my mind but now like I said I got no one to vote for Im sure you can understand that reason,109,4,0.03669724770642202

The people of Wales should have a vote yes or no on leaving the EU under the terms which the English Prime Minister agrees with our friends in Europe If the terms are worse than staying where we are the people of Wales should have the right to reconsider their position The people of Scotland have the option to reject Westminster dictat why not the people of Wales and the people in the north of Ireland Even the people of England might have second thoughts when they see the terms of the retreat from Europe,95,1,0.010526315789473684
Why not grow a pair instead of trying to convince yourself you can change the mind of torys for a better of wales or at least leaving us in the same circunstances Theyve already rejected the promises they said they will give us they dont care about the importance of the single market to Wales You should be doing more to stop Wales being dragged down,66,5,0.07575757575757576

Its the fact they said previously that if it turns out brexit isnt in the beat interest if Wales they will fight against it They havent in the slightest They are still saying they are trying to work on terms that will be good for Wales I think its pretty clear even before the referendum its never gonna work out well Now farmers and our funding will be no more and they are still trying to get round brexit Why not campaign to show and inform the people of Wales what the eu has done for us which shouldve been done in the main campaign and then show what were getting of Westminster once we leave or not getting Theres been so much misinformation after the amendments are done and all there needs to be someone explaining to the masses in laymans term whats gonna change costs etc and see if people then change their minds The annoying thing is there no opposition and the ones who slightly are against it like plaid and lib dems still arent fully against it,181,14,0.07734806629834254
My caveat is that I dont believe there can be any beneficial exit for Wales from the European Union,19,1,0.05263157894736842

Brexit is not about economics but about Nativism and Nationalism It was forced on the cowardly Tories by those Purple Nazis led by that Weasel Farrage He is selling English exceptionalism not Welsh Irish or Scottish cultural preservation The Celtic parts of Britain need to get away from England or be willing to become entirely subservient to an English nationalist agenda The EU is the only protection for Celtic identity,70,4,0.05714285714285714

I see the compassionate side but obviously she has taken advantage of the UK by being here for the last 8 years I hate the sob story side of it as it portrays the system as brutal but the other side of the coin is that she has knowingly used UK Resources for 8 years  now shes been told it has to stop is playing the sympathy card I see both sides but  its a big but there is the law  exceptions are way too often made for high profile cases  that should not be the case all should be equal under the law  she has known this was a possibility for a long time  accepted the risk she was not legally entitled to be here but chose to take advantage of the fact she was rather than legally return  make the required application from her own country probably knowing it would be refused so I am not without compassion but see a pattern of misuse of our system  a calculated gamble by her which now shes lost her final hand  stake is begging for a stake from other players sorry but I dont think we should feed this addiction,200,3,0.015
She was legally entitled to be here There was no advantage taken no resources used illegally You are still being petty minded You still cant see her humanity can you All you see seems to be in relation to advantages and resources and misuse and cunning This is you saying these things Take a long hard look at yourself It is not very pleasant,64,0,0.0
On the contrary when her father passed she should have returned home she chose to stay illegally at the time and appeal the system from here was then given leave to remain while being considered  having lost her appeal for reasons both you  I are ignorant to  surmising is now playing her last hand with her joker the sympathy card no its not emotional viewpoint its a cult iCal factual one that the law should apply the rules are the rules  they are there for everyone  for the record being in the university I have seen student numbers drop from local children as there is more money to be made in foreign students  places  funding put out of reach of local children indeed my own son could not afford to complete his degree here because of funding cuts  limits  I believe that this sort of drain on the system by these people is part of the issue she has revived tens of thousands in funding while shes been here which she shouldnt have had  will now never pay back  that is whats wrong with this country she should never have been given the funding to do this in the first place without already being given indefinite leave to remain,209,4,0.019138755980861243
The cuts of which you speak are Tory austerity policies They have little to do with these people an unpleasant phrase that very dehumanising Your son cant afford to complete his degree due to the astronomical rise in tuition fees engendered by yep you guessed it the Tories again My daughter is lucky enough to be a welsh lass living in Wales so she gets her uni fees subsidised to a much more affordable 3 grand a year That is still harsh what with living fees and all The loan system is a farce but its all we have,99,1,0.010101010101010102
I and my son are in Wales too  trust me its not just the tories who are to blame especially in Wales,22,1,0.045454545454545456
Dustin pretty obvious I dont share your view but even if I did Seen as she has been here for 8 years what harm would another 100 days or so do  to give her time to finish her studies Surely thats the least we can do in view of her hard work to date,54,2,0.037037037037037035
I would personally have no objection on compassionate grounds to delaying her deportation 100 days but I understand the principle that requires her to leave I also have concerns that then qualified she may then use this to further her cause to remain thus our compassion may give her the opportunity to further manipulate the system it is clear she is very articulate  clever,64,0,0.0
For my money Id say clever articulate highly qualified and highly skilled engineers are just the sort of people we want and need in this country Im glad that we can at least agree that the timing is horrible and that there is a good case for a compassionate extension I do take your point about upholding the rule of law but when a case like this highlights the arbitrary and inflexible nature of some rules to me its a sign that something is wrong and that we need better law,91,1,0.01098901098901099
Agreed however I dont think it should have come to this it should not have taken 8 years she should have gone back when her father diedobviously after a compassionate period  made to apply from her country as others do instead she remains  used the system to delay her rightful repatriation the system should have dealt with her long ago to avoid this so yes it needs reviewing  tightening Yes I agree we need engineers rather than the publicised leaches many are however however the ends doesnt justify the means for me in this case,95,3,0.031578947368421054
It hasnt taken 8 years Thats when she first came here on her fathers visa as I understand it,19,2,0.10526315789473684
Btw I was thinking more that the law should be flexible enough to deal with exceptional cases,17,1,0.058823529411764705
Just remember flexibility in the law is how those in power abuse it as with politicians expenses etc if it had been you or I we would have been tried  convicted,31,1,0.03225806451612903
Shes been living here since the age of 12 Do you seriously think she would know the country she was from after being deported back She was here legally under her fathers name and by right that should apply to her considering she was 12 when she came over legally At least shes doing more than some people who are scrounging off illigally on benefits in this country A large Majority of British born cant be bothered to study or get work Because they stay home and watch Jeremy Kyle and out on the piss with our hard earned taxes they Just claim benefits instead of working and contributing to society So I think she has every right to be here Than those who are work shy,127,3,0.023622047244094488
Not at all in any way your unsubstantiated statement that I am without any knowledge of me shows your ignorance  true character which is far more discriminatory than mine I assure you,32,0,0.0
Jan Williams I agree with the first half of what you say however she obviously has not got the right to be here otherwise she would not have been ordered to leave under our laws which Im not saying are perfect or right but are what we currently have As you will see above I have had a very reasoned discussion about this without name calling I agree there are many  varied views but we are governed by laws given to us by the EU in this case  so we must all abide by them like them or not,99,1,0.010101010101010102
Dustin I dont really want to talk too much about my day job  just to say its an area that is very heavily dependent on the application of UK law In my particular field there are many relaxations and concessions that try to take into account the messiness of real life It doesnt always have to be black and white,60,2,0.03333333333333333

Well done to Robert Peston With Brexit and the emergence of ukip it is noticeable that when interviews are shown of general public on mainstream media  there is often a longing for good old England I presume that means that without Europe the Queen of England and her cronies can return to treating the welsh and other Celtic peoples as retarded bumpkins who are not capable of autonomy,68,3,0.04411764705882353

Our accents whatever they are make us British As an eastender living in Wales I have often have to repeat myself because some find my accent difficult to understand and I have suffered discrimination In my school my accent was regarded as common and lacking in refinement  but who really cares Its this diversity  that makes Britain Great You are what you are,63,1,0.015873015873015872
the majority in Wales have English accents due to the influx of coming from over the border Youll struggle to hear a Welsh accent on the news There are English accents all over Wales If anything the Welsh accent is the minority in Wales these days its what defines us if we havent go our accents or language what do we as Welsh people have absolutely nothing,67,2,0.029850746268656716
Where I live Welsh is the first language although everyone speaks English and can switch between them in an instant which is ok I tried learning the language but despite asking our friends and neighbours to speak to us in Welsh to help us learn they couldnt help but revert to English if we struggled Its a shame really because if we go abroad we dont expect the locals to speak English and we have to make the effort to learn some of the language to get by In my opinion even the road signs should be in Welsh only,100,3,0.03
yes i respect your opinion however I would say the more of the influx we have the more damaging it becomes to our language for the simple reason that many of the English consider English to be the only language of Britain Ive met English people who are very welcoming of the Welsh language however once you break the mold of thousands of years of a language in the stronghold areas of Wales it dies out You cant have migration and diversity and it not affect the culture which is already in the minority without it being for the negative My grandfather always said  Welsh was always taught as the language of Heaven English was taught as the language to get along in life,124,3,0.024193548387096774

To be fair thats not true at all In areas of SouthEast Wales other Welsh people say Gwentians and such have Englishsounding accents but the English tell us we sound Welsh One of the factors is that the dialect of Welsh once spoken in the area Gwenhwyseg effects the accent of the spoken English AND the pronunciation of Welsh names Like the neighbourhood Gaer in Newport Theres a really old and large hill fort up there so people have been calling it that for yonks But instead of the pronunciation you might find elsewhere in Wales Gaier in Gwent the pronunciation is Gehr because of the diphthong mutation in Gwenhwyseg,110,11,0.1
I take your point Rhys Roberts and that is fair comment I think the different languages and dialects within the UK are a bonus but my east end accent was beaten out of me at school and work which is why I appreciate wanting to preserve the Welsh language and many english families here have opted for their kids to be educated in the medium of Welsh especially at primary school I must say that when I moved to Wales 14 years ago I was shocked as to how few Welsh people in South Wales either spoke or wrote in Welsh or were unable to even understand spoken Welsh,109,1,0.009174311926605505

Fantastic value for money when you consider the cheapest sky package and the excellent promotion of the language that S4C does plus regional programming with BBC Wales being particularly strong especially considering the strength of investment in Welsh studios which has not been so forthcing from the private sector Scrapping the licensed fee for the Welsh to save money is akin to cutting g off your testicles to aid fertility,70,2,0.02857142857142857

What has groundbreaking have to do with milking chickens Groundbreaking is irrelevant when youre talking about what is a social broadcasting institution Whilst there is always innovation the aim is to entertain the masses Personally I have little interest in the majority if modern British television but I Am not the key The aim is to please and inform a broad audience This year the Government has asked that they deviate from this a little and offer more local programming with less emphasis on chasing ratings mainly because of close Government ties with Sky and the Telegraph The figures that the BBC gets speak for themselves and prove their worth httpwwwbarbcoukviewingdataweeklyviewingsummary,111,4,0.036036036036036036

I demonstrated above with a link how great the BBC is in terms of value for money S4C isnt valued by you just as the BBC London weather report isnt valued by Me It is valued by an awful lot if Welsh speakers Sky has very little to offer at a month BBC costs around a tenner a month and provides much more than just some TV channels Radio regional broadcasting web services etc In spite of your myopic focus on the new BBC building the BBC expenditure has been drastically cut with even more money being ploughed into regional broadcasting such as Made In Cardiff Where the BBC made massive cuts by closing down its London studios a mistake the government instead if lasting savings on to the consumer opted to increase the finding for the regional independent broadcasters for cities like Cardiff and Swansea so there are thing that can be fine about the licence fee but the BBC whilst it has its genuine problems does not have problems in terms if value for money appeal or waste The BBCs problems lie in its fear of any incumbent Government as it has recently become less independent due to a restructure in 20152016 Regarding the term better see relativism and subjectivism and also take stock Of The fact that BBC does not repeat quite as much as Sky and non terrestrial channels are want to do,237,5,0.02109704641350211

The reason why we have uniforms in schools is because yes one for smartness The other is because there are families that cannot afford every day clothing or the latest gear for children who need to keep up with the rest of the children in the latest trend of fashion Also if anything when they are on school trips they are easily found and locate the correct number of children  If they are in a busy area It also represents respect and pride of the school Also it helps that child aware that being neatly dressed for work is pride of appearance and representing the company they are working for So if you can explain to the families who cannot keep up clothing their children for every day clothing and not wear uniform you are clearly wrong on that answer Also to those who take pride in their apprearance and not a fashion trend Would you be happy to be served by someone in jeans and Tshirt in a supermarket but yet you cannot identify the person you need help from So many shoppers which one is staff So there is a reason behind uniforms and unfortunately you didnt quite think your post through,204,3,0.014705882352941176

True But hopefully there will ALWAYS be a market for Welsh lamb and Beef  Quality before quantity ,17,0,0.0
Pete Grimshaw  I wish I knew the answer to that I find it totally baffling I hear the argument that we had to take back control but in effect this just means handing control to Westminster 93 of produce from Wales is sold to the EU and as you say farmers will now have to compete with NZ  60 of products from Swansea and Cardiff are also sold to the EU It appears Wales has voted to further impoverish ourselves put people out of jobs reduce opportunities and risk alienating the very people who keep our services running Im fearful for the future,103,2,0.019417475728155338
Pete Grimshaw I believe and I hope Im not proved wrongthat Wales will benefit from being in the World and European market That the farmers will be oversold due to the demand for Premium produce Also once the market has stabilised  as confidence grows  investment from the commercial sector will naturally follow But this can be exploited by the unscrupulous As we have seen from the Senned when they sold million of land in Cardiff for million to a Jersey consortium that they have  to my knowledge  never been brought to account for I may be talking a load of bollocks but my glass is  half full  The EU and its army are finished  depending on the French Dutch etc elections  time to move on,125,5,0.04

I have never understood the mentality of the Welsh on the subject of the EU When you look at the fundalmental principles of why EU is so important to the welfare of all the people of Europe it was always the idea of making Europe a fairer more open society One of the means to that end  Was the distribution of wealth from the richest to the poorest where ever possible Therefore Wales had so much to lose and now hasto vote in favour of leaving the EU being influenced by jingoistic xenophobic bigoted right wing press is the biggest example of self harm committed by a people To me the comparison is like the Jews of Nazi germany voting for Hitler,122,3,0.02459016393442623

Not all of us Welsh voted to leave There is still a mentality of Wales and the Welsh being inferior to the English and remember that in some areas there are conclaves of English retirees who dont think of Wales as a different country Also obviously the valley areas who benefited most from the EU probably feel disconnected from Wales and being Welsh Also there is still some divide between North and South  we are ignored by our own Senedd and Welsh speakers and non Welsh speakers But cant blame the English for everything Some people are stupid that they voted because of the fear of immigrants in areas that have barely any immigrants And it remains unsaid that the only immigrants that have taken our jobs homes and stifled our language and culture are the English,137,3,0.021897810218978103
I find the irony about immigration really frustrating I do believe that the perception of immigration has been so influenced by the media The vile right wing headline immigration from the EU and put a picture of a women in a burqa But in truth the people of Europe are white Christian Social democrats Therefore by voting to leave the EU and stopping immigration from the EU will only mean more from India Pakistan Bangladesh which are Muslim So i dont understand the logicWish someone could explain it to me,90,4,0.044444444444444446

Sadly Wales is partly to blame for the lack of enthusiasm for the Eu for those who take little or no interest in politics and often then continue to follow the labour tradition to vote  along with plaid said to be at times the party more of rural Wales its hardly a surprise the Eu input to the country went largely unnoticed  as it went largely on labour vanity projects or was hidden behind the Welsh labour banner then some were just plain wasted  I dont think the true input of the Eu was fully know or even understood ,99,4,0.04040404040404041

Roberta Borsotti there are a lot more English immigrants living in Wales especially conclaves of retirees of the Brexit mentality Also nobody wants to acknowledge that the English are the majority of immigrants in Wales For centuries the English establishment has played divide and rule and sadly there are still Welsh people who are unaware of our history and how the English government has subjugated us over the centuries Thats why I feel more European than British The Scottish are more confident than us in their national identity and have their own laws,93,4,0.043010752688172046

Whilst we all remain quiet and allow people like this to get away with belittling all that is Wales we will never win respect for ourselves throughout the World  the native Americans are speaking like never before through media etc and politicians are asking for respect and help for them  we must also raise our voices not just expect a few of us to do so in our masses to let the world know we are not a pushover and that we will no longer tolerate the bullying tactics of Westminster and their ilk portraying us a region of England or that we are unable to go it alone  The truth is England need us more than we need them  they know if Scotland and Ireland go that without us they will no longer be the powerhouse they try and portray themselves to be and will no longer be the colonising country they have always been Wales does have the resources and talent to be able to govern ourselves and by doing so will allow our country to prosper in the world and not be put down by a Westminster who wants us just to be their little slaves And before anyone says we voted for Brexit  I KNOW  but those who REALLY CARE FOR WALES  will not stop fighting for her  Plaid Cymru it seems  is the only party who truly has all of Wales regardless of ethnicisity language or creed  Please wake up Wales now is the time to do it for our children and grandchildren  Gydan gilydd fe safwn ni  Together Stronger,265,9,0.033962264150943396

As a Welsh person who voted remain I take offence at being lumped in with the all the leave voters in Wales The Welsh have brought it on themselves The Welsh deserve it I and the other leave voters dont deserve it and neither do those in the rest of the UK One of the reasons I voted remain is that I believe we are stronger united as the UK and as the EU Another reason being that it was blatantly obvious that any funding received from the EU to Wales or any other parts of the UK would not be honoured by those in power So please dont say that all the Welsh voted to leave thats as untrue as saying all of the UK voted to leave or Brexit is the will of the people We are divided into leave and remain just like everywhere else,148,4,0.02702702702702703

Dustin Pitman Despite the shameful populism and blatant lies told by the leave campaign pre ref 48 of the people who turned out that day voted to stay in Our political representatives are voted in to look after all our best interests Please tell me how dropping out of the EU single market is in the Welsh peoples interest when it accounts 68 of our exports  90 of our farming exports Whats the post brexit strategy for securing new markets  and how long will it take  do you know What happens to businesses and jobs in the mean time,99,2,0.020202020202020204

i agree about the press but having access to the facts allows me to know that it is massively Left wing  controlled by liberal ideology for ulterior motives my former occupation allows me nor insight than many As for political education MINE started at 6 being largely brought up bey my grandfather EX military  great grandmother who was a devout socialist  marched with NYE Bevan  was very active politically I was very aware of the crippling strike consequences  causes in the late 70s early 80s and like many lived in one of the hardest hit areas with family in the industries involved  family working in GCHQ at the time I was very well informed as a young adult  forged my opinions early seeing even then the value or great diplomacy  orators which is sadly lacking today in 90 of politicians  an impartial free thinking education should start at secondary school level not younger or with indoctrination by political leaders as Leanne has done As for political autonomy Wales as a whole doesnt want independence but yet again Leanne  Plaid fail to acknowledge this  so therefore again are not representing the majority  so will never gain power Plaids MP are of absolutely no use to Wales unless there is a minority government where their vote is required  currently that isnt the case I personally knew two of BG old MPs who were not party affiliated  both expressed with honest futility their place in Westminster as a lone voice in the wilderness  so the MP position from a purely logical viewpoint is best served by being from a party of power to effect benefit which Plaid will never be sadly As for them making us safer that is nothing more than romantic idealism they have no parliamentary government experience if Leanne is the yardstick they have no idea of diplomacy she is an embarrassment to all in that department  she has no real grasp of what the people want or need but spends the majority of her time indulging in her own views  agenda along with her ever embarrassing vocal showboating As for respect she is losing that rapidly as is plaid due to her deployment of personal policy as that of plaid  Wales she needs to resign  allow someone with diplomacy vision  drive to affect the things they can rather than expend energy on that they cant,396,15,0.03787878787878788

Perhaps if some of the people commenting above gave a moments thought to the implications both constitutional and economic they might arrive at a slightly more mature understanding An issue as important as membership of the EU or withdrawl should NOT be decided by a simple majority of a low turnout The leave proportion of the electorate was approximately 37 with a majority of some 56000 in an electorate of over 3000000 in Wales Such an issue should not be regarded as valid unless at least 80 of the electorate participated with a minimum of 75 majority vote to decide That would more accurately reflect the will of the people,110,1,0.00909090909090909

Obama never enacted any travel bans though If you bothered to research the policy youll see that what actually happened was the US Security forces doubling down on vetting on incoming peoples from Iraq in response to a terror threat Obamas ban did not happen nor did the increased vetting affect green card holders or refugees who had already been through the vetting process Essentially all that happened was an increase in waiting time for new Iraqi applicants due to a more rigorous vetting procedure As for the Israeli point the PM hasnt invited any of the heads of states from those countries for an official state visit we can tackle that issue if it ever occurs All you are doing by raising this point is dabbling in Whataboutism which is a ridiculous attempt to discredit Leanne Woods position as youve failed to refute or disprove why we shouldnt condemn a quite frankly poor counterintuitive policy,156,9,0.057692307692307696

There is a fundamental constitutional issue here The referendum reflects the will of those people that voted on a given day six months ago Since then it has become apparent that many of the statements and assurances made by the Leave campaign were entirely without foundation and often lies It therefore cannot be certain that those people who voted Leave or Remain would choose to vote in the same way now that they know some of the facts Since the Tory leadership change Theresa May has acted very much like a medieval prime minister She has regarded parliament with at best disdain and at worst superfluous to her government Her entourage have aped her and made statement implying that anyone who disagrees is somehow traitorous She has attempted to rule by the royal prerogative something abandoned centuries ago Our MPs who we elect to act to represent the range of views and interests of their constituents appear have largely abandoned this role transfixed by the success of the Leave propaganda and the referendum result Even though the majority of MPs were and are proRemain and for many their constituents are Remainers they appear to have abandoned their duty to represent their constituents and their diverse and varying interests and concerns They are there to hold the government to account If MPs are simply going to follow the diktat of the coterie that compose the cabinet then there is little purpose for having them We might as well abandon our current political structure and simply vote for the Prime Minister and allow that person to assembled a Cabinet from the great and the good,273,2,0.007326007326007326

Martin Davies Perhaps there are a few superficial signs that the economy is going from strength to strength but these are illusory at best The retail sales peak was driven by a boom in tourism following the fall in the value of sterling Sterling was kept from falling through the floor by vast sums being spent by the treasury to prop it up Already food and other commodity prices are rising A significant number of companies are reporting falls in sales due to economic uncertainty and the fall in real earnings Yes we all took a pay cut The Leave campaign alluded to continuing support to farmers but it is now apparent that this is very short term and it is highly unlikely that the new global markets will pay significantly higher prices so that farming is economic In all likelihood the trade deals that UK enters into with the brave new world out there will include full tariff free access for US Canadian Australian and NZ farmer to UK markets and UK will be flooded with cheap fish and meat Where the Leave campaign did lie was lying by omission It simply failed to provide answers to serious questions and responded too often by deriding the questioner,208,0,0.0

Martin Davies The other aspect you dont see is companies pulling out of major contracts because underlying inflation is making the contract nonviable I work in the public sector procurement and I am watching several contractors getting ready to throw the towel in because commodity costs have gone through the roof due to the fall in sterling We will then have a choice seek contracts of the same value but for fewer services or higher prices for the same services In both scenarios the public looses There are other contracts were due to Dollar  Euro  Sterling exchanges components have gone up by 30 since the referendum but we must buy the items Therefore something else in the public sector has to be cut By midyear I estimate that this will start really hurting Also due to Brexit key skill workers who were already in short supply are returning to the EU and there are no UK  Commonwealth qualified personnel to replace them Even if there were the money in place and the political will it would take 57 years to train UK apprentices to the required skill level Many UK school leavers are so poorly equipped in terms of numeracy and literacy that they cannot get onto the skill training courses Our contractors simply cant deliver services because there is no one in the market to do the work Just because you dont see it in your life now please do not assume that the predictions are not coming true Mrs May and her gang will tell you anything to make it look like they are in control they are not,271,4,0.014760147601476014

As might be expected Carwyn Jones and Leanne Wood produced a so called Brexit plan for Wales that would impoverish the residents of Britain and totally ignored the reality of the populations of these islands The British bulldog is primarily a hefty English body with Scottish ears nose and wrinkles and a north of Ireland double chin Wales best fits its tail Why Jones and Wood thought that the Welsh tail could wag the British Bulldog in preparing for Brexit when the Bulldog had so much to gain from the Leave change of environment will be beyond most rational people Why Jones and Wood consider that the British would want to give up the opportunity of negotiating our own deals with the USA and the Pacific nations and accept crumbs from Brussels as a single market membership would dictate will escape most business leaders logical sense Why Jones and Wood believe that the British should wish to be hidebound by E U Brussels regulations after the problems they have caused for 20 years will baffle most people Yet Jones and Wood propose all these handicaps as good for Britain How amusing Why Jones and Wood anticipate that the British would want to open the flood gates for millions more immigrants from current and future E U countries to cross the channel when the nation has given such a clear referendum NO is a mystery Apparently in Jones and Woods view Wales is such an unattractive country that the flood of immigrants will not wish to cross Offas Dyke How insulting to the country that we love Britain will negotiate a positive new deal for its citizens If Jones and Wood want to cling to the discredited current E U deal their plan should be a simple one Dock the Welsh tail from the British bulldog and initiate a referendum for Welsh independence Find out if the residents of Wales have confidence in them,323,5,0.015479876160990712
Are you offering your help in initiating that referendum That would be most helpful,14,0,0.0
I think its time for Plaid to be ahead of the curve and start calling for a referendum on Welsh independence if Scots and Irish have referendums soon And make case that independent Wales would get a better deal for Wales either if it were an indepenent country in the EU or outside I dont agree with Tom Brooks on the EU but he is right that Plaid needs to change the debate here in Wales otherwise were debating within a British context which well always loose,87,2,0.022988505747126436

Because of Brexit the value of the pound has decreased which means exports are cheaper Wales will be able to export more  taking into account we may not get a free trade deal and have tariffs imposed which the EU will have to pay us as well of course our exports will still gain as the pound has devalued by around 20 and tariffs will be nowhere near that So Brexit is actually a win win all round for Welsh exports Plaid need to wake up and start putting the Welsh first,92,2,0.021739130434782608

Tomos Williams Are you serious Tariffs are applied as a percentage do you understand what I am saying I wouldnt think New Zealand has much use for our Lamb And Tariffs apply both ways and as we import more the EU will have to pay us more and it was suggested by the Government last week that if any UK Business loses out through tariffs they could be compensated through the profits we will accrue,75,2,0.02666666666666667

How do you work out that the EU has to pay tariffs to the UK It is the importer that pays to his own exchequer Any duties on Welsh imports will land up with Westminster and as we now know there is a very good chance that those duties that you have paid on imported goods will go to subsidise corporation tax cuts for large companies in England rather than Welsh hill farmers The drop in exchange rates is poison for any country that imports more than it exports as in the case of Wales Also even though Welsh exported goods may theoretically be cheaper through a lower pound this does not automatically mean an increased amount of sales as in the case of a saturated market such as that for lamb for example It can also just mean the goods being sold for the same price as before but the extra profit is kept by the seller and in the globalised market that seller may be the same company who is getting the tax subsidies from Westminster mentioned above,180,1,0.005555555555555556
