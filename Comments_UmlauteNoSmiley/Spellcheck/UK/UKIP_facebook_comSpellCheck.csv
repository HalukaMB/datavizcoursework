However in the case of Iraq Saddamm should have been removed in 1991 we had won the war back then There was no reason to have left him in power When he was finally removed in 2003it was the right decision to bring down his despotic regime He was put on trial Judged by Iraqi Judges in a Court of law and found guilty of crimes against the Iraqi people and sentenced to death by hanging And The Sentenced Was Carried Out By Iraqis and not the American military unlike the end of World War 2 We have brought democracy to Iraq and its people The women have voted and expressed themselves in their elections While their new government is far from perfect it is a far better new system of government than what they had under Saddamm  The Surge had succeeded under George WBush it was the decrease in forces under Obama that led to disastrous policys While the region is not completely stable it is a viable situation that can lead to success in the long term provided we dont abandon Iraq prematurely Once the terrorists are eventually defeated in Iraq we can decrease our forces It will be up to the Iraqi government if they want a small permanent American military base like we have in Germany Japan and South Korea If they dont desire that then indeed we should leave completely,235,8,0.03404255319148936

Maurice the people of Britain should come first until poverty is eradicated in this country then no one else should benefit from our generosity Up until late 2015 we were giving foreign aid to India who have more millionaires than us and are able to fund their own space program Is that fair Also do you not think under labours regime the tax payers money would be wasted They did the last time they were in,76,0,0.0
The people of Britain have always come first 70p out of every made in the UK economy goes towards foreign aid That leaves 30 out of every to use for education social care the NHS benefits etc etc More than enough to ensure no families are having to use food banks,51,3,0.058823529411764705

Remember back during the referendum campaign that us Remanians and all the experts in the world said that growth would slow and the economy would be damaged if we vote to leave the EU and how Brexiteers all shouted Project FEAR Remember how in their ignorance they delighted in the fact that the economy hadnt been destroyed in the first 90 days Thats the thing about an economy its a bit like a table top supported by several legs You can take away one of the legs and itll still stand up like it has for the last 9 months after losing 17 of the value of the GBP it takes time for that to damage the economy There are various sectors that change at different speeds So where are we 9 months in Well 3 of the four legs holding up our economy are nearly completely broken and we havent even left yet According to the Office of National Statistics things dont look great out there Worries that the UK economy is losing steam have been strengthened by news of a housing market slowdown a drop in industrial output and the weakest performance for a year by the construction industry Economists on Friday said there was growing evidence that the UK economy slipped down a gear as it entered the new year Economic indicators point to strains on companies from higher costs as the pounds slump makes imported materials and fuels more expensive Consumers the main driving force of UK economic growth are also under pressure from rising inflation with signs they are becoming less willing to spend in shops restaurants and bars A key component of the slowdown just announced from the ONS has been relatively weak retail sales in the first two months of this year Consumption is expected to moderate further this year as increasing inflation erodes households purchasing power But exports will be brilliant said the Brexiteers because they are cheaper with a devalued currency and yet the trade gap widened in the last quarter because we import more than we export and it is all more expensive for the UK to buy anything from anywhere in the world So back to those legs under the table Industrial Production Down Construction Down Retail Down Manufacturing output Down Currency Down Housing Down Job creation Down Interest rates Down Wages Down  just because inflation is going UP this is not a good thing But hey Im just talking the country down arent I  if that is the case then why dont Brexiteers just talk it back up again After all they keep telling us that there are more of them than us Remoaners,446,14,0.03139013452914798

Boxed into a corner The most dangerous of Mrs Mays illusions has been her claim that no deal is better than a bad deal Her letter this week steps back from this notion but only a pace To revert to trading with the EU only on World Trade Organisation WTO terms would cause serious harm to Britains economy It would mean the EU imposing tariffs plus a full panoply of nontariff barriers on almost half Britains exports No big country trades with the EU only on WTO terms An acrimonious breakup would make it harder to cooperate in such areas as foreign policy and defence And it would surely increase the risk of Brexit triggering Scotlands exit from the United Kingdom Mrs May needs not merely to soften her tone as she has started to do this week but to lower expectations Instead of threatening to undercut her European partners by building an unregulated SingaporeonThames something that despite its appeal to freetraders would horrify most Brexit voters or hinting that Britain might cooperate less fully on security or claiming that the EU needs Britain more than the other way round she should accept that in these negotiations she holds the weaker hand She should hence be more flexible over payments into the EU budget a subject her letter skates over  Economist,221,11,0.049773755656108594

Remember back during the referendum campaign that us Remanians and all the experts in the world said that growth would slow and the economy would be damaged if we vote to leave the EU and how Brexiteers all shouted Project FEAR Remember how in their ignorance they delighted in the fact that the economy hadnt been destroyed in the first 90 days Thats the thing about an economy its a bit like a table top supported by several legs You can take away one of the legs and itll still stand up like it has for the last 9 months after losing 17 of the value of the GBP it takes time for that to damage the economy There are various sectors that change at different speeds So where are we 9 months in Well 3 of the four legs holding up our economy are nearly completely broken and we havent even left yet According to the Office of National Statistics things dont look great out there Worries that the UK economy is losing steam have been strengthened by news of a housing market slowdown a drop in industrial output and the weakest performance for a year by the construction industry Economists on Friday said there was growing evidence that the UK economy slipped down a gear as it entered the new year Economic indicators point to strains on companies from higher costs as the pounds slump makes imported materials and fuels more expensive Consumers the main driving force of UK economic growth are also under pressure from rising inflation with signs they are becoming less willing to spend in shops restaurants and bars A key component of the slowdown just announced from the ONS has been relatively weak retail sales in the first two months of this year Consumption is expected to moderate further this year as increasing inflation erodes households purchasing power But exports will be brilliant said the Brexiteers because they are cheaper with a devalued currency and yet the trade gap widened in the last quarter because we import more than we export and it is all more expensive for the UK to buy anything from anywhere in the world So back to those legs under the table Industrial Production Down Construction Down Retail Down Manufacturing output Down Currency Down Housing Down Job creation Down Interest rates Down Wages Down  just because inflation is going UP this is not a good thing But hey Im just talking the country down arent I  if that is the case then why dont Brexiteers just talk it back up again After all they keep telling us that there are more of them than us Remoaners,446,14,0.03139013452914798

Definitive proof is never easy in war zone situations but Bashar alAssad and his regime have a strong track record for using both Chlorine and Sarin against their own people The SNHR Syrian Network for Human Rights has recorded in excess of 140 such incidents the worst being on 21st August 2013 when they bombarded East Ghouta resulting in the death of 1500 civilians and injury tom a further 5000 mostly children women and the elderly They also reported that in 2016 alone Syrian government forces delivered 12958 barrel bombs like Chlorine gas and Sarin nerve agent gas these bombs are illegal under the Geneva convention So I suggest the weight of probability overwhelmingly points to alAssad If anyone wants to believe otherwise because they dont like Trump they are free to do so but I believe such bias deflects their view away from the reality of this heartbreaking conflict,150,9,0.06

The Cyrus Report Wednesday April 5 2017 Syrian Rebels Admit Responsibility for Sarin Gas AttackIt was NOT Assad Syrian rebels in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta have admitted to Associated Press correspondent Dale Gavlak that they were responsible for last weeks chemical weapons incident which western powers have blamed on Bashar AlAssads forces revealing that the casualties were the result of an accident caused by rebels mishandling chemical weapons provided to them by Saudi Arabia From numerous interviews with doctors Ghouta residents rebel fighters and their families many believe that certain rebels received chemical weapons via the Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar bin Sultan and were responsible for carrying out the deadly gas attack writes Gavlak back up version here Rebels told Gavlak that they were not properly trained on how to handle the chemical weapons or even told what they were It appears as though the weapons were initially supposed to be given to the AlQaeda offshoot Jabhat alNusra We were very curious about these arms And unfortunately some of the fighters handled the weapons improperly and set off the explosions one militant named J told Gavlak His claims are echoed by another female fighter named K who told Gavlak They didnt tell us what these arms were or how to use them We didnt know they were chemical weapons We never imagined they were chemical weapons Abu AbdelMoneim the father of an opposition rebel also told Gavlak My son came to me two weeks ago asking what I thought the weapons were that he had been asked to carry describing them as having a tubelike structure while others were like a huge gas bottle The father names the Saudi militant who provided the weapons as Abu Ayesha According to AbdelMoneim the weapons exploded inside a tunnel killing 12 rebels More than a dozen rebels interviewed reported that their salaries came from the Saudi government writes Gavlak If accurate this story could completely derail the United States rush to attack Syria which has been founded on the undeniable justification that Assad was behind the chemical weapons attack Dale Gavlaks credibility is very impressive He has been a Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press for two decades and has also worked for National Public Radio NPR and written articles for BBC News The website on which the story originally appeared Mint Press which is currently down as a result of huge traffic it is attracting to the article is a legitimate media organization based in Minnesota The Minnesota Post did a profile on them last year Saudi Arabias alleged role in providing rebels whom they have vehemently backed at every turn with chemical weapons is no surprise given the revelations earlier this week that the Saudis threatened Russia with terror attacks at next years Winter Olympics in Sochi unless they abandoned support for the Syrian President I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us Prince Bandar allegedly told Vladimir Putin the Telegraph reports The Obama administration is set to present its intelligence findings today in an effort prove that Assads forces were behind last weeks attack despite American officials admitting to the New York Times that there is no smoking gun that directly links President Assad to the attack US intelligence officials also told the Associated Press that the intelligence proving Assads culpability is no slam dunk As we reported earlier this week intercepted intelligence revealed that the Syrian Defense Ministry was making panicked phone calls to Syrias chemical weapons department demanding answers in the hours after the attack suggesting that it was not ordered by Assads forces UPDATE Associated Press contacted us to confirm that Dale Gavlak is an AP correspondent but that her story was not published under the banner of the Associated Press We didnt claim this was the case we merely pointed to Gavlaks credentials to stress that she is a credible source being not only an AP correspondent but also having written for PBS BBC and Saloncom Source httpswwwinfowarscomrebelsadmitresponsibilityforchemicalweaponsattack Cyrus Leone,686,41,0.0597667638483965

Definitive proof is never easy in war zone situations but Bashar alAssad and his regime have a strong track record for using both Chlorine and Sarin against their own people The SNHR Syrian Network for Human Rights has recorded in excess of 140 such incidents the worst being on 21st August 2013 when they bombarded East Ghouta with Sarin gas resulting in the death of 1500 civilians and injury to a further 5000 mostly children women and the elderly They also reported that in 2016 alone Syrian government forces delivered 12958 barrel bombs like Chlorine gas and Sarin nerve agent gas these bombs are illegal under the Geneva convention So I suggest the weight of probability overwhelmingly points to alAssad If anyone wants to believe otherwise because the dont like Trump they are free to do so but I believe such bias deflects their view away from the reality of this tragic and heartbreaking conflict PS  I hope the mad fat malevolent manchild Kim Jongun can put down his latest toy fireworks for long enough to watch the news youre next fatboy,182,14,0.07692307692307693

I am disappointed in UKIP for this opinion This was EXACTLY what should have been done in 2013 after the first chemical attack that killed hundreds of civilians by Assad Obama and the rest of the world did nothing The little children that horribly died this week might have been saved if actions had been taken then To do nothing in the face of evil merely empowers more of the same evil Decent people and stronger nations must step up to stop this from happening again This was a narrow specific attack on an airfield to prevent chemicals from being used as weapons again Well done Mr President,108,2,0.018518518518518517

I wonder if Paul Nuttall made these comments after listening to the former ambassador to Syria yesterday morning I would suggest the ambassador has a far greater grasp of the Middle East mentality than many who have jumped to conclusions in the media Assad has everything to loose and nothing to gain from chemical attacks however someone in his military who knows the game could cause all these deaths and reaction A bit like prodding the West with a pointy stick to provoke a reaction,85,1,0.011764705882352941

My point of view is this russia are no worse than us and america although russia is in the right for one reason alone reguardless of chemical weapons democracy dictates the following assad is democratically elected and there far has the right to defend his country from the rebels they are terrorists we are backing them so is america russia is defending democracy in syria and im sorry to say someones gotta losr for it to end its is for the people of syria to determine there future by the vote but while there is no winner it wont make a vote happen so let them fight it out get it over with so peace will follow a victory all we are doing is being guilty of making it last longer if we are to fight we should defend assad with russia so the democratically elected goverment can get peace and end it and rebuild their country and defeat the terrorist side people are gonna die it would be the same in any civil war so get it won and stop it fast and work with the winning side and help them retore peace the second world war cost millions of lives both military and civilian but it ended in 5 years this could end in months yea civilians are gonna die but less will die in months than will in years someones gotta win for peace,237,19,0.08016877637130802

Reality bites With Job Seekers Allowance at a week that is approximately a day that some people have to live on Since the referendum the value of the GBP has fallen by over 17 or approximately one full days income has been lost for those on the smallest incomes I guess that means that they can eat for just 6 days a week then and go hungry for 52 days per year With retailers and supermarkets either increasing prices or shrinking product size right now as a result of the increased cost of Brexit electricity and gas bills set to increase by 7 from this month and inflation expected to top 3 by the end of the year interest rate hikes cannot be far behind  when interest rates go up so do mortgages and when mortgages go up landlords put up rents to their tenants So adding all this up by my back of an envelope calculation your average job seeker is going to lose the equivalent buying power of another 23 days income by the end of the year each week That is a loss to him of over 100 days a year of the basic JSA benefit payment What are people supposed to do for that third of a year Does anyone in their right mind actually think that the Government is going to cover these losses for the poorest people in our country Gee nice one Brexit and all the fools that voted for it without understanding that there ARE consequences to voting blindly on a pack of lies,262,4,0.015267175572519083

David Hollas Indeed In practice Holyrood has just robbed Local Councils of the powers they already had thus inherently meaning Scotland is a weird kind of Unitary State inside another Unitary State Much better idea would be to scrap Holyrood altogether and give the decentralized I dont use the word devolved as a rule as its an absurd term powers from london to the Councils directly Real Local Government without a hideous 000000  000000 per year in maintenance architectural monstrosity in Edinburgh and all those salaries of the gaseous politicians that inhabit the thing All the taxpayers money wasted on devolution can go on something genuinely useful like public engineering works or the health service  ,115,5,0.043478260869565216

Im glad that UKIP as a party have began talking about Islamism in the public sphere Even calling it Islamism was beyond Obamas capabilities for 8 years The only way we can solve the problem of jihad without unnecessary violence is by talking honestly and openly about it and not letting ourselves be bullied into silence by selfrighteous middle class progressives,61,6,0.09836065573770492
As a self proclaimed self righteous middle class progressive I jave to say I agree with you on this We probably disagree over many issues but I think there needs to be a more open discussion in which we acknowledge that a very tiny minority of Muslims commit terrorist acts but without assuming all Muslims are evil which i know from experience not to be true and while noting that many non Muslims also commit terrible crimes however they are often labelled differently,83,2,0.024096385542168676
Talking wont work Islam is a 7th century mysoginistic fascist ideology  once there is enough of them to take over Maagid Nawas not sure about the spelling is trying his best to bring about a reformation to his religion he has bodyguards twentyfour seven for his efforts Do you not think there is something desperately wrong with this ideology when the penalty for leaving is DEATH The quran tells them it is okay to lie to kaffirs because they are not muslims We are the kaffirs by the way Thats why trying to do deals with Iran over their nuclear program will mean nothing to them And think about this if theyre happy to blow themselves up how much better would it be to blow everything up in the name of their deity,133,11,0.08270676691729323

I agree again although I meant discuss the solution rather than the problem eg more focus on rebuilding Middle Eastern countries to tackle the root of the problem as opposed to just the symptom sending all Muslims away would only increase rensenment towards the West and create more instability in already damaged countries and could worsen the problem in the long term The Bible as a book is actually more violent than the Quran and none of us would have declared the KKK peaceful The majority of Muslims condemn this violence so even if it is built into the religion it is not necessarily practiced except it clearly is as Roger points out but a lot of the instability is linked to the West invading and if we responded violently which we unfortnately do doesnt that make us just as bad Given that muslim terrorists are a drop in the ocean compared to all other peaceful Muslims in the West how can we punish all of them in the name of peace,172,8,0.046511627906976744

Linda I clearly did not say that Making the distinction between Muslims and Islam is the most important distinction you must make if you want to have a meaningful conversation about the topic Islam is a wide array of moral and cosmological propositions the majority of which are not conducive to human wellbeing and those that are are not exclusive to the faith Muslims are people who accept some of these propositions I mean Islam makes it incumbent upon Muslims to kill Jews on sight but the simple fact that the vast majority of Muslims dont do this proves the vast majority of Muslims only accept certain ideas found within Islam to be true Criticising ridiculing and defeating bad ideas so that people can voluntarily change their beliefs is what we must do Ridiculing Muslims as people is pointless,139,2,0.014388489208633094

Rose Islamic terrorism is derived from belief in propositions about the nature of the universe we live in found within in Islam Discord in the Middle East can undoubtedbly catalyse violence through the lens of Islamic terrorism but it isnt the only answer Many Muslims who commit terror offences or hold Islamist views have never been to the Middle East in their lives Indeed the most hardline demographic of Muslims in the west are 1824 year olds followed by 24  30 years  most of who have never set foot in Asia in their lives Secondly yes the Bible is also violent and the KKK are nutjobs But that is a separate issue Were talking about Islam here not Christianity We cant keep comparing everything to the extremely low bar that Christianity sets because a its pointless and gives a low target to aim for we can do better and b you cant have an interesting discussion about problems uniquely pertaining to Islam if somebody is trying to derail the conversation by issuing criticisms of Christianity I agree that this is also a conversation that needs to be had but its a separate conversation You also seem to think that theres a West vs IslamMuslim dichotomy here Not true The overwhelming majority of the victims of Islam terrorism and cultural jihad are Muslims themselves Besides Western actions in the Middle East havent always been bad Sometimes they have been severely misguided and have made things worse But for example the people of Iraq had been petitioning the US to save them from the scourge of Saddam Hussein for over 10 years before the Anfal campaign an assault on the citizens of Iraq with chemical weapons by Hussein inspired them into action Again I never suggested punishing all of them I never suggested deporting all of them I didnt suggest this for one This is a fantasy you have created because these are not my views and they arent the views of anybody Ive heard speak about this issue We must win the war of IDEAS with ISLAM not ridicule MUSLIMS as PEOPLE,351,15,0.042735042735042736
Roger Ive read them all my friend and Im very familiar with Gabriel too I think youre right in your implication that at some point we need to define the connection between Islamic ideas and Muslim behaviour but how we are to do this and use this information in a noninvasive and useful way I wouldnt even know where to begin So for now I content myself and it seems youre doing similarly good work with trying to win the war of ideas Also check out Gad Saad if you havent already Hes great,94,9,0.09574468085106383

Rose Wood Most people whove flooded into the west are economic immigrants not refugees and when they arrive multiculturalism  espoused by liberals means they can set up their parallel societies In these societies they can carry out practices and express views wholly unacceptable in western democracies and political correctness and regressive liberalism means anyone who criticizes them is bullied and abused to shut up Your attitude towards these issues is dangerous and wrong They do not integrate we do not need them economically they are searching for maximum economic benefit and they are a major economic drain and cultural threat to the west,103,1,0.009708737864077669
Robert Polatajko as you might expect I disagree Sadly you are probably right about there being less refugees as we refuse to let them in I feel the word flooded is a little overdramatic given less than 5 of the UK is Muslim and that includes people who have lived here for generations But nonetheless that is a significant amount and so needs dealing with but multiculturalism is a solution not a problemwhat you have described is the opposite We should put more effort into encouraging integration as most people who come want to be part of society it benefits everyone I think youre right about not being able to criticise but I think thats starting to change since Brexit we just have to be careful its criticism as opposed to abuse I personally dont have a problem with immigration but thats a different story but understand if people do and reducing immigration is a reasonable thing to want but it shouldnt include racial discrimination or kicking people out whove lived and made their lives here Also remember these people arent coming from luxury even if they are coming for economic reasons most dont want to come and live solely off benefitsits hardly the life of riley and they come because of desperate economic situations back home what else can they do Our economic situation is far more due to austerity and big businesses taking advantage of workers than it is immigration Sorry for the super long paragraph,248,14,0.056451612903225805

Ed Waddington Do you also condem the violence of antifa and their fascist policy of shuting down any opinions and ideas that they disagree with,25,4,0.16
John Brennan antifa is an organisation which opposes facism Facism is a dangerous ideology which can be directly translated to many millions of deaths in the last century Opposing groups who profligate surrendering their will to the state is something Id support Whilst I agree those groups should be opposed and challenged and exposed however I dont believe they should be silenced After all those ideologies are much more dangerous if allowed to fester and sit under the surface Whilst I despise the populism of sections of UKIP including farage I dont believe they should be silenced Its arguably that UKIP and groups like britain first have had a positive impact on any fight against extremist political beliefs by being so comically crap and so exposed that mainstream British beliefs largely reject them Theyve been so awful theyve also led to people on the edge or ignorant of certain minorities or views to challenge their own opinions so as not to be aligned to them,165,11,0.06666666666666667
Ed Waddington Antifa is an organisation that doesnt appear to actually know what a true fascist is or what true fascist ideology actually means  To violently attack journalists from right of centre organisations or to shutdown university professors who have forgottenmore about facisim and dictatorships from behind a black mask make this plainly clear I notice you do not condem the violence,62,7,0.11290322580645161
John Brennan firstly Id argue antifa will know what a true facist is ergo the groups they challenge Id say challenging journalism which crosses the line The daily mail enemy of the people for the brexit judges doing their jobs springs to mind should be something any decent person does Theres a difference between closing down and challenging people If I was walking through a street and I heard someone being openly racist nasty and vicious or inciting hatred Id challenge them I dont see that as facist for closing them down but what we should do in a decent society As for violence well any group who goes out and starts fighting others violently has lost the debate Not discussing it hardly means I dont condemn it does it,130,7,0.05384615384615385
Ed Waddington Ah so your a fascist if we say you are  I wonder just by who and how this decision is made It seems to be antifa have become the like the real facisim of the thirties Will you condem the violence of antifa,45,5,0.1111111111111111
John Brennan of course I condemn the violence if all groups A facist is quite simply someone who fits the definition of one Whilst this is complicated I would say this is someone who would use the instruments of state over the individual to pursue an agenda which is ultra nationalist that is advancing the cause of its citizens based on their nationality driven by creating fear of other ethnic groups nations or people For example britain first are a profoundly facist group as is evidenced by their manifesto UKIP Id class a mishmash of facists anti federalists libertarians and if truth be told idiots Thats presumably why the party implodes at every opportunity The depressing state of politics is there is no start and end or solution But facism isnt it,132,8,0.06060606060606061
One thing is for sure  theres a lot in Britains even modern history to be wholly ashamed of  from policies of starvation in India to the black and tans But in the 1930s with Europe ravaged from the great depression only one major or minor power entirely and completely turned its back on extremism ,54,3,0.05555555555555555
So it seems that antifa has nothing to protest about in Great Britain or the USA but should be extremely concerned about the rise of political Islam concept which has concepts that are close to that of National Socialism just replace nationality with religion Just what the recent history of great Britain has to do with it I dont know but perhaps we could add the millions killed in the religious war between Hindus and Muslims in India in the late forties or how Mugabe killed his rivals then turned Rhodesia which was the breadbasket of Southern Africa into his own personal kleptocracy Yet when a gay English satirist who is right of centre tries to speak on a university campus its complete meltdown time,125,3,0.024

Ah the good old days eh We will look back in 5 years time and wonder why jobs arent being created The 200713 EU Structural Funds are estimated to so far have helped create more than 50000 jobs in the UK assisted the start up of more than 20000 businesses and supported more than 1300 research and technical development projects Funds are used to support a wide variety of projects such as building skills for the unemployed increasing the participation of women in science and engineering careers and developing new healthcare technologies And this is just the EU structural funds there are dozens more that used to pay tens of billions into the UK economy as EU Members Shame about that eh The good old days when the EU provided Northern Ireland with a total allocation of around million Scotland with total funding of around million Wales with total allocation of around 145bn England with a total allocation of 174 billion And that was just the European Regional Development Fund,170,2,0.011764705882352941

firstly dont speak on the behalf of hastings or our economy You know nothing about us stop pretending I sometimes shop fresh from the huts for small catch and theres a few issues with your stories 1 currently some most seafood restaurants in the area are incredibly high priced because the produce is caught on low numbers  maybe or maybe not to do with current quotas  which in turn means the fisherman sell it at a higher cost Suddenly the quota lifts and more fish are caught and sold More fish available for restaurants and the price comes down suddenly you have a farming issue around ethical pricing towards the produce caught and sold Supply and demand becomes an abstract Look at the current issues around farmers being paid fairly for produce by supermarkets which is regularly intervened by the eu to offer financial and diplomatic support to farmers 2 these fishing communities and seaside towns get a shed load of funding from the EU How is the council and other fishery bodies supposed to assist in the sustaining of the fishing communities when the funding suddenly does a runner back over the waters,194,4,0.020618556701030927

POSTBREXIT WILL BE A DREAMLIKE TRANSITION TO SOLO and for the real reason we are leaving the EU please read to the endRussia alone needs ringing by NATO THE RELEVANT LABOUR PARTY FUTURE according to Blair is not to descend into Brexit bickering but to barter a future lead on the new idea at the fore of new political thinking in the postBrexit era before us Rejecting the far Left himself when in office he led a firsttimer centre rightwing Labour as a magnate to all those who admired the Tories but could not give that party their vote He won over the middle classes and many wealthy bosses as well as drawing the voting working class towards Labour He had the people with him because he offered them something tangible that improved their lives If Brexit uses the same method it will be a political success and Britain will have emulated his triumph Onwards and upwards vote centre with one foot in the Labour camp and one foot in the Tory camp until we see which foot has the best leg to stand on Now Jeremy Corbyn has to be far further Left than Blair as it is more in his own nature to be so And Labours true modern appeal to a restless and as yet undiscerning voting public of the poor majority Transferring his personal preferences from self to party is proving a rocky road that many Labour voters think reflects his dereliction of duty in policies that fall short of true conviction though on the contrary this can be fairly assumed to be an overpessimistic view of his political stance always made in good faith JCs policies also show he has remarkable humanity Like Blair JC has said he will house the homeless But the Police think they rely on making a man homeless to control crime rapists cannot be brought indoors or lunatic violent men And there are too many of them to strictly police when accommodation always means another police call Blair was simply told no he couldnt bring them in But a ban the bomb PM would only make the enemy attack as they would know he is mad in an atomic age when terrorists are waiting to break down peace at any cost And Labour is in the wings claiming it is using its time before the next election to formulate new policies it will present then for postBrexit is a wobbly uncertain future yet to be defined and attempted in no vain hope that the Tories will succeed The British are no fool when it comes to winning through adversity with tenacity hope courage and national pride well in place Labour can only be the running mate in the wings until we see exactly what it is we are dealing with including our divorce from the EU which appears to produce more than one tactical error in its wake Labour is playing the waiting game but is it enhancing JC or is it denying him Labours true image with a Leader who can in the future lead a new Britain Blair was always new Blairs New Labour of old now becomes Renewing Labour with its safe new Britain in a brave new world calling upon some of its old political strengths to garner for this new era And some of JCs he can reveal to us in his own timely manner JC can make a marriage between what we have already and where it is going to take us now PostBrexit will be his newborn baby and he has to show he can Father our nation Whilst good old Theresa May is proving she is Mother Nature herself in her PMship she has turned into a natural role for a politician adaptable and with true genius hers is a flawless and uncompromising rivalry as she rises to every challenge astute and aware of difficulties arising she deals with so sublimely It is going to be a dreamlike transition from EU to our going it alone and May will make many new friends for Britain to create our new economy We can be confident of our Tory postBrexit a challenge JC can rise to but can he climb over and above for Labour The future will tell Tony has told Jeremy make policy to reflect Labours values Tony was great Theresa is a natural politician who will make the transition easy Goodbye EU When its war in Europewe hope you can get your money out to fight each other for Germany is their forced unwilling puppet on Russias side and she will drag Poland and the Czech Republic in with her For Russia left procommunist leaders in place And they are frightened of Russia,792,24,0.030303030303030304

just looked up the meaning of racism and this is is prejudice discrimination or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that ones own race is superior i dont believen i am superior above any other denomination in my community who has a house or a job that could be filled by someone local i dont think anyone local is superior either iblame the people with power by letting in so many that there is segregation and not intergration i blame those in schools system starting in westminster for not teaching the morals needed for life about hard work and money also about being realistic it seems so many have ideas that they are above a certain job maybe if we get that sorted as well as not letting foreigners here with no regard for our own i believe we need to sort our own house before heloing others charity begins at home remember that form your younger days tolerance of others is becoming such a watch word in so many areas of life and it will come back and bite us in the bottoms one day those in london in the seats of power are untouched by what us living in the real workd face im not racist or sexist but it is time to look after our own in the early 8s we fought for a small island thousands of miles away how many will feel the need to defend gibraltar especialy those from abroad,252,18,0.07142857142857142

Thanks for waiting patiently Keith lets just clear your comment up first and then i will educate you on why your comment was along the lines of racist Firstly I am a conservative which is the other side of left wing and you simply commenting I have a left wing mind doesnt make it true I am however not racist I voted for brexit  to leave the EU because I believe it is the right choice for the uk to control its own borders as the uk is heavily populated already and controlling immigration would stop many people coming to the uk to claim what is not rightfully theirs and a few other reasons such as jobs and housing for the young adults Secondly you just singled out a whole religion as the reason why immigration is bad for the uk are their issues with extremism in the Uk yes are all Muslims bad  Well its estimated that their are 3 million Muslims in the UK if they are all terrorist like many people claim then you would all be dead already its the few who are extreme that claim then want sharia law This will never happen because the uk has its own government and own laws If anything needs to change its that we stop letting people immigrate who bring nothing to the uk no money no skills no degree Let the people who will actually become doctors police engineers builders and other valuable jobs in and remove the benefit bludgers ,253,12,0.04743083003952569
Not racist at all you may be conservative but you are a politicaly correct moslem apeaser You are the part of the problem and you dont even see it Whatever the nunbers can you tell me whe 14 of jails are moslem theres are not 14 of the population not to mention the number that should be in jail yes they are the problem thanks for your class of how to be a moslem apeaser if thats what you call educated your wrong but im a little older and PC is not me where its part of your brainwashing they call education the dunbing down process Even after all the terrorits attacks all the gang rapes across the country you cant see the problem thats not eduction thats ignorance you cant solve problems if you can not admit there is one in the first place,145,16,0.1103448275862069

All Im basically saying Keith is your one of the people who voted for britex just like me but you did it because you have a clear dislike of Muslims and immigration where as I voted to leave the eu so that future generations can have jobs and buy houses and for the government to stop giving handouts to nonBritish people,61,4,0.06557377049180328

Carl John Yallop  Carl please do not assume anything about me or my reasons for voting to leave the EU With children and grandchildren I understand your concern for the future of the young but I firmly believe that their future will be better protected with the UK out of the EU Heres the latest available unemployment figures for those between school leaving age and 25 years old in Europe Greece 2 Spain 9 Italy 1 Cyprus 328 Portugal 264 France  262 Bulgaria 4 Belgium  204 Luxembourg  199 Sweden 185 UK 126 Germany 5 the only EU country with single figure youth unemployment surprise surprise No stable and buoyant economy should have youth unemployment above 175 That is why youngsters from all over Europe are exploiting the freedom of movement act to get to the UK and take jobs that should be there for our own youngsters When we joined the EEC as it was then as its 8th member in 1973 its share of world economic output was 31 It has added 20 more members since then to see that share diminish to a mere 165 pretty smart that add 20 members in order to see your share of world economic output almost halved a quick look at some of the lame ducks given membership  1 billionand 7 other members make net annual contributions while the other 20 receive net subsidies  Luxembourg being the biggest beneficiary another glass of Jean Claude Junker  The Italian banks are on their knees coughing up blood a quick look at the economies of EU member states reveal terminal illness everywhere The EU and in particular the Euro has destroyed Greece decimated the economies of Spain Italy and Portugal with the main beneficiaries being Germany and France so why anyone visualises this insular protectionist union as some sort of economic utopia is quite staggering When I voted to join in 1973 I was voting to join a common market not a political union that has been heading like a runaway train towards a single government federal state This fact was hidden from the public by the treacherous Ted Heath and his government until it was revealed in 2001 under the 30 year disclosure law which detailed the reaction of himself and his government to the Werner report It was also revealed that Geoffrey Rippon said to Ted Heath at the time If we want to join the EEC we will have to sacrifice the British fishing industry which is exactly what the traitor did reducing our fishing protection zone from 200 nautical miles to 12 devastating hundreds of communities and bringing the largest fishing industry in Europe to its knees and it affected the whole country before this every high street in the country and every secondary shopping parade boasted at least one fishmonger supplying delicious cheap healthy food for the whole country from the bountiful stocks of the North Sea youre old enough to remember that as am I Apologies for a lengthy reply but my reasons for wanting to leave are many and carefully considered  there are more many more but you may be asleep by now PEACE,526,6,0.011406844106463879
Thanks Alan for taking the trouble to reply in detail I can only reflect on the last 40 years of prosperity we have had early signs are not good an admission that immigration will not change and a continent possibly facing conflict that we thought could never happen again time will tell if our divided nation can ever unite again I suspect you and I will be long gone I wish you well,73,0,0.0
Carl John Yallop  Carl I reflect on 40 years of prosperity achieved in spite of EU membership not because of it The EU will implode within 5 years Hungary and Poland will be the first to go they have both been refusing to accept refugee quotas imposed by the EU since 2015 claiming that a decision to impose refugees on an unwilling member state was culturally and constitutionally unreasonable The EU will soon offer them an ultimatum and with right wing governments in both countries they are certain to refuse giving them no choice but to leave this overcentralised bureaucratic shambles of a union behind them Greece Italy Spain and Portugal will be hanging onto their coattails  its over wake up and smell the Weetabix I wish you well also,130,3,0.023076923076923078

The Gibraltar referendum said otherwise,5,0,0.0
Tery Dudman bearing in mind that the British people who inhabit Gibraltar want to remain British I think the inhabitants have a say and the history of why gibralatar is british is as follows An AngloDutch force captured Gibraltar from Spain in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of the Habsburg claim to the Spanish throne The territory was subsequently ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 Regarding Hong Kong it was on lease to us as followsIn 1898 the British and Chinese governments signed the Second Convention of Peking which included a 99year lease agreement for the islands surrounding Hong Kong called the New Territories The lease awarded control of more than 200 surrounding small islands to the British In return China got a promise that the islands would be returned to it after 99 years So we had to give it back So no one could complain does that answer your questions,164,8,0.04878048780487805
Terry Dudman sorry but you are so wrong Gibraltar was ceded in perpetuity to Britain in 1713 The ChinaHong Kong situation was completely different  Hong Kong didnt have a choice as they were ceded to China on a 99 year lease Gibraltar is British we are British and will continue to be so until we the Gibraltarians decide otherwise,59,4,0.06779661016949153

After watching the utter drivel coming through the Media from MPs lately I feel this has to be clearly stated on all ruling parties behaviour on running this country What other Country in the worlds Parliament would vote to send billion pounds of Tax payers Money in aid to other countries while having the largest child poverty of the richest countries while allowing their own elderly to sit alone neglected without care and with a failing health service What other Country in the worlds Parliament would pay 200 million a day of Tax payers money to a corrupt European Union to keep all the countries in Europe while in order to do this run massive debts up in their own country let their own countries infrastructure crumble and erode until it is almost non exsistent social care community care health care Then force their own working class to work past a humane retirement age and work till they drop to pay for all this for other countries to benifit What other Countries Parliaments would allow a modern mass immigration of such that it displaced the natural residents in many areas of this country and allowed these same immigrants to impose their unwanted culture forcing the removal of our ownWhat other Country would allow these millions of immigrants access to Free pensionsfree benifits free health servicefree education and housingall of which we have to work a lifetime and more to pay for  Labour Conservitives Lib DemsSNPYES the people of this country WERE lied to as all of the above clearly shows We put the fate of this country into the hands of Politicians and look what you have done to it That is why we will not be told UKIP does not have a place anymore because they are the only party we have not given a chance to see how they would set things right again,316,11,0.03481012658227848
