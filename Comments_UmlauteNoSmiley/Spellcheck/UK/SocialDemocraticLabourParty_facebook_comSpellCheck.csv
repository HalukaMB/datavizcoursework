Im a member of the UK Labour Party living in Northern Ireland I agree with your broad Brexit strategy supported my local SDLP candidate in a small way in recent campaigns but also disagree with some SDLP policy particularly on reproductive rights and also would like the Labour Party to stand candidates here in future I know technically I can be a member of both parties but are me and others in my position really welcome This is a genuine question btw rather than trolling exercise,86,5,0.05813953488372093
It really would help if there was a government in place to present a formal written and sovereign position as that of the SDLP and Northern Ireland Dublin 100 took and adopted as its own the SDLP lead in 1985 and it delivered peace in roughly the same timeframe as Brexit will take to complete Same PES jersey required to drive the Green view on the greatest challenge since,69,5,0.07246376811594203

ORIGIN On 28 January 2017 protests erupted at airports across the United States over President Donald Trumps issuance of a executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven countries In a 29 January 2017 statement he said America is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave We will keep it free and keep it safe as the media knows but refuses to say My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror To be clear this is not a Muslim ban as the media is falsely reporting This is not about religion  this is about terror and keeping our country safe,170,2,0.011764705882352941

It is time to do something different Something radical something that will catch the interest of the voters Something that will ignite and excite them and blow voter apathy away Something that will give them hope that now is the time for change That now is the time for a better way It will take strong leadership and the acceptance that not everyone currently involved in yesterdays politics will be elected 1 SDLP and Alliance merge bringing as many independents as they can Call themselves the Social Democratic Alliance 2 UUP and TUV and every other Judea Front merge call themselves the Unionist Coalition 3 Then do a pact sharing 50 of the seats and launching a joint campaign for Vote For Change there is a Better Way This would leave Shin Fane and the DUP out in the cold Pie in the sky I suppose but it time for the grownups at Stormont to do something different and capture the publics interest,163,8,0.049079754601226995
