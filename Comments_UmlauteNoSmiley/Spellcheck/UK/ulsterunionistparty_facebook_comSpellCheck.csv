The weakest unionist leader in living memory in fact ever  he just doesnt get it  The 1st job of a unionist leader is protect the union  giving your vote to a Republican Party sdlp is not protecting the union  It is helping to destroy it FACT ,46,3,0.06521739130434782
So youd rather be dealing with Sinn Fein Great,9,3,0.3333333333333333
Richard it is up to the unionist people to select there leaders it is up to there leaders to protect the union  It is not the job of a unionist leader to select who republicans put in government  That is there business  And answer to your question I would rather do business with none  But the Belfast agreement says we do  so to keep the union safe we must always return the maximum of unionist seats  In my opinion mike has signed of on death off the Ulster unionist party a bit sad really ,94,0,0.0

To those people who are voting DUP consider this If you knew that the DUP and Foster were at the centre of the RHI scandal costing us million and making no attempt to prevent in would you still vote for them I dont think you would We will know in 3 to 4 months when the Judicial Inquiry report comes out exactly what part the DUP and Foster played in this scandal Your judgement is being tested Lets get it right for the sake of our countrys reputation,88,6,0.06818181818181818
Good point By then we will know exactly who knew about it SF only agreed to a full public enquiry once they brought Stormont down I wonder why When we find out that they knew what was going on its to late People will have voted them back into power as well Seems nationalists have short memories were SF are concerned,61,1,0.01639344262295082
Are you judge and jury Lets see the result of the judicial inquiry I think your eagerness to blame Dup maybe premature,22,1,0.045454545454545456
Michael what do you know or are you guessing The info that the News Letter and BBC have brought into the public domain along with Mr Bell point to a very serious problem for the Dup and Foster Tell us what you know,43,1,0.023255813953488372
Helen  a bigger issue than who knew what is who was doing what Dont get hung up on how republicans will vote We know the answer to that More concerning is will unionist vote through fear or for change,39,1,0.02564102564102564
I know that the press etc have tried to mislead us on quite a few issues EG Brexit Trump etc if you believe all in the press your a bigger fool than I thought However I do believe in innocent until proven guilty Also I do not support a man like MrNesbitt whom advised unionists to transfer votes to a nationalist party,62,5,0.08064516129032258
William no right thinking unionist wants the ira to become the largest party in stormont people will never forget what sfira did to unionist communities here thats why they will vote the dup its not scaremongering would you like to see the ira become the largest party in stormont,49,7,0.14285714285714285
Michael  Im from Londonderry and in this area around 2000 unionist vote for SDLP in the Westminster elections and that is to keep SF out The Executive we are all trying to elect is called a mandatory coalition which will have a unionist and nationalist party At present we have a partnership team of SFDUP Now by voting beyond our own party we can influence who the other party in the coalition will be Its called using our head,79,3,0.0379746835443038
Gordon  What unionists are you talking about that wants SF to become the largest party The UUP are trying offer nationalists an alternative to transferring to SF by voting for a party that has not been involved in scandal after scandal this last 10 years There is no long term future in scaring people into voting for a political party We need to be working on our future I will not respond to your last ridiculous point,77,1,0.012987012987012988
Nessbitt just wants power He is not the man to lead unionism He should be trying to unite the unionist voters not divide them If he were to do this just maybe we could have proper government Surely that would make better sense How can anything work when the people in control are pulling in opposite directions Do you honestly believe Mr Nesbitt is a better negotiator than Mrs Foster I think Jim Allister is right in what he says  we need proper Government like Scotland and Wales have Maybe if the UUP would consider this it may help hinder its decline Very sad to watch,106,4,0.03773584905660377
Michael you are correct it is sad to watch and there is too much negativity about With a possible break up of the Union there is an interesting rise in the number of people who declare themselves as Northern Irish In 2011 the census figures reported that 40 of NI was British 25 was Irish and 21 was Northern Irish A recent poll recently put the Northern Irish population rising to 34 with British and Irish dropping The border is becoming less of an issue only when people want to use it to stir up a cause or at election time The last ten years have not been good This can not be as good as it gets I believe we have got to help the nationalist community overcome the political carnage that is the SF and we have got to fight our own demons Then I think we can all learn to live together,155,0,0.0

Dear Mr Nesbitt as a gospel minister I was disappointed at your decision to abstain in the same sex marriage vote Your decision along with the vote in favour by one of your MLAs handed a propaganda victory to the same sex marriage lobby Your lack of leadership almost led to a change in the definition of Biblical marriage Marriage is a Divine institution not to be tampered with by man As such I cannot in good conscience vote for any candidate or party that would directly or indirectly open the door for its redefinition Your action in this matter has diminished confidence that the UUP can be trusted to protect the traditional view of Biblical marriage I hope you will listen to my sincerely held and principled position Regards Noel Hughes,132,3,0.022727272727272728

If were going to talk about union then please explain why the DUP refuse to bring some of the laws into Northern Ireland that the other devolved assemblies have brought in and they continue to block As well as that will they continue to back the government with Brexit and take backhanders or the people of Northern Ireland who dont want it If your worried about a united Ireland just stop and think for one second We would need a referendum on that,83,3,0.03614457831325301

I would like to thank Mike Nesbitt for all he has done in this election Although Im a nationalist and living in Ireland this man really shows how unity really works The way he speaks is like it is more important to have a united community in the north than a United Kingdom or United Ireland Thanks for your forward thinking fairness and equality from a nationalist who now has faith in unionists You are a hero to me ,79,2,0.02531645569620253

Of course Republicans  Nationalists will thank Mike Nesbitt its beyond comprehension that a Unionist of any ilk would urge through their actions others to vote for those whose aspiration is the destruction of the core value of their own party the Union As Adams stated in assumed privacy  equality is the trojan horse There is no inequality in NI of course there is a Nationalist wish list to further Irishness within NI at the same time eroding the British identity Unionists are branded dinosaurs for daring to say this and to those I say shame on you I am not an admirer of Arlene Foster but when she talked of crocodiles she should have said that appeasement does not work under any circumstances and those being appeased will simply demand more and more I have no issues with those who wish to speak Irish but I do have serious issues of spending millions of tax payers money that should be spent for the betterment of the entire community ie health education etc I have no issues with same sex marriage I am not a Christian nor am I affiliated to any church but I do object to churches of any religion or denomination being forced to conduct marriage ceremonies that are contrary to their beliefs Of course many would brand me as a dinosaur or a bigot but the truth is I see myself as more tolerant than those who sieze upon perceived or manufractured Injustices to further their own agendas I am fiercely proud to be British and if all elected individuals were sincere in their desires to make NI work then the notion of a United Ireland would become a relic of the past Be warned Sinn Fein having all Ireland power would take this island back to the dark ages,303,8,0.026402640264026403
You make some good points John The issue I would like to have seen pushed more was the constitutional position It has been settled Its all done and dusted All the parties signed up to it It takes 75 to even just begin the question Last years poll it was 27 That is literally a lifetime away This election was not about that it was about the here and now about RHI accountability and competency in government A transfer at this election to SDLP was not a vote for a united Ireland A protest vote a kick up the bum whatever way you want to see it Also for two parties who want to power share who signed up to it Yes it should have been handled better hindsight and all that I think Mike wanted to get away from the simply Union at all costs strategy of voting As regards Sinn Feins vote I am guessing here but it wouldnt surprise me if a sizeable percentage of their increase were in fact Catholic Unionists who dont normally vote but saw them as the best way to kick back against their perceived arrogance of Arlene and the DUPs attitude Some of them voted for Alliance but not the UUP and I guess that is a question the party will have to explore,222,8,0.036036036036036036
I would certainly agree with your comments Dermot that many took the opportunity to register a protest vote against the DUP I do however believe that Sinn Fein seized the opportunity of the RHI debacle to strike a blow against Unionism Read posts by Alex Maskey that confirm their true intentions The problem we now face is that Sinn Fein are emboldened by the result and regardless of the reasons of no doubt well intentioned people they will use it to further their own agenda no party is better at spin and rewriting history Involuntary coalition is always going to cause problems and is in reality unworkable until all accept your well made point that a United Ireland is a lifetime away if there was a desire for it I do not like to refer to religious divides etc you certainly as you are obviously well aware dont have to be Protestant to be a Unionist or indeed a Catholic to be a Nationalist The problem we have is that no Nationalist  Republican Party will tell their people that a United Ireland is an unlikely prospect in their lifetime That in itself generates mistrust in the Unionist community which is exploited by many in the DUP etc Until all can convince people with sincerity that they are working for a better NI for all with no underlying actions to destroy its very existence then we will not achieve what Mike Nesbitt was looking for He was naive in the extreme to attempt it at this time He took the lead and got scant support from his intended partner in coalition so he was doomed to failure and achieved nothing more than strengthening the position of Nationalists and weakening Unionism which will make devolved decisions for the betterment of all in NI difficult if not impossible Sinn Fein will accelerate their agenda of eroding anything British deepening divide which suits them whilst Unionists continue to bicker divide and conquer is a tactic they are using to their advantage,337,16,0.04747774480712166

Hi Ian In many ways I wish Northern Ireland had never been created as Home Rule may not have been so bad but then there was the dominance of the Catholic Church in Ireland as a whole and then the calls to arms by both sides in 1912 and then the 1916 rebellion made the messy compromise of Northern Ireland and an Irish Free State inevitable Ive just been watching Spotlight on BBC One NI about powersharing here and elsewhere or lack of it What a wasted opportunity 1974 was Brian Faulkner Gerry Fitt Oliver Napier  Co undermined by the Demon Doctor as Faulkner called him continuing mainly IRA violence and a weak British Government 1998 is not quite wasted yet but on Spotlight Bertyie Ahern admitted himself that they spent so much time talking to Sinn Fein thus undermining the SDLP because it was SF who had influence over the guns David Trimble was already being undermined by continual sniping by Paisley who only ever wanted to be topdog over refusal of the IRA to disarm and for republican support of the police So we are where we are and the two governments at the time which had strong mandates  no excuse for weakness must share a lot of the blame for elevating extremes because they magnified their importance The Union Well with Brexit in the mix its clearly made things messy but again we are where where are The Good Friday is intact The principle of consent is intact If the Union is unsafe it is not Northern Ireland or Irish nationalists that are making it unsafe it is Brexit UKIP and possibly the SNP I am content to have ever greater relationships between North and South and within and between these islands Relationships build stalemate splits and stagnates The UUP secured the principle of consent and the abolition of Articles 2  3  so I support the UUP But my support is not unconditional  I am liberal minded and any truck with the DUP will have me opting elsewhere,341,16,0.0469208211143695

There is a choice to be made at Stormont for any Unionist party willing to be in government and that is whether they are happier to share power with the SDLP or with Sinn F  I assume your own preference leans towards the latter then What Mike Nesbitt said is essentially that hed rather not have the DUP and Sinn F as the too biggest parties and hes going to vote accordingly,72,8,0.1111111111111111

Having a fundamentalist Christian agenda is a significant part of our current problem By all means have your faith more power to you but politics should be secular The bible has no precedent regarding and subsequently no relevancr towards the vast majority of discussion and actions required of our assembly Indeed when religion raises its head within the political institution it is more often than not used to either justify the unjustifiable or to make a bitter pill easier to swallow You do not consult with God on practical matters such as when buying a car or when considering a quote to repair a leak in your roof so what relevance does God have in a political institution which is focused almost entirely on practical matters,126,1,0.007936507936507936

Is the ability for two people to marry really your biggest issue here right now Why is it of such significance to you,23,0,0.0
I know it sounds homophobic  and I stand with any one who has that cross to carrybut the issue is the Law of Godmarriage in its authentic form should not be closed to Gods gift of life Even a pensioner couple are not closed Fecundity is the blessing of any nation and is its absolute life blood turn this over and all abberations come  plus chastisement from God,68,3,0.04411764705882353
I understand you dont get to pick and choose which parts of the Gods law you follow as a Christian What I dont understand is why the fixation on this particular issue Why marriage specifically Im not sure exactly which biblical references you have used to establish your conviction but I have an idea Im going to give sufficient credit to you to assume that the story of Sodom and Gomorroah doesnt influence your viewpoint particularly as both Ezekiel and Jesus himself clarify that the real reason for their destruction stemmed from social injustice and a lack of hospitality and the perversions described in Jude 17 is clearly a reference to the ill intent towards the angels Ill stick with the NIV for the sake avoiding ambiguity considering there are literally hundreds of English translations of these verses and many of them bear littles resemblence to each other Gensis 224  That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife and they become one flesh This one is interesting because Eve was created to be as God described a helper to Adam Interestingly she was also only created after God and Adam considered whether any of the beasts could also be helpers instead Thats pretty disconcerting Leviticus 1822 and Leviticus 2013 are both fairly clear in what the forbid in the NIV so I can understand your viewpoint based on these verses It is unfortunate that you seem to have such callous disregard for Leviticus 1919 then I mean I dont know you personally but I can see at least two breaches of what it says in that verse in your profile picture alone Is this a less important verse Why is this particular portion of Gods law less significant in your eyes Im not even going to bother with a deconstrutcion of the story of David and Johnathan in 1 and 2 Samuel as Im sure you will tell me that Your love for me was wonderful more wonderful than that of women was some form of poetic license and David didnt really mean that Anyway I digress I am curious why your main political motivation  having seen your postings here and elsewhere  appears to be the opposition of Marriage Equality when the party you are choosing to endorse to further that goal are such fateating Lev 317 blindeyeturning Lev 51 uncleananimaltouching Lev 52 neighbour deceiving Lev 62 rabbiteatingLev 1147 Lev 111012 footballplaying Lev 118 mixedfabricwearing Lev 1919 beardgrooming Lev 1927 tattoohaving Lev 1928 foreignerdisrespecting Lev 193334 landselling Lev 2523 lying Lev 1911 stealing Lev 1911 hypocrites But at least you know your conscience is clear right,444,28,0.06306306306306306

I think its possible he might have played a blinder actually Theres no way that election broadcast was taking itself seriously It was intentionally tounge in cheek and gives more than a nod to how ridiculous the whole institution has become Its also the only one anybody is talking about If recent election results have told us anything its that whats odds on at the bookies isnt always what actually happens,71,4,0.056338028169014086
well done mike courageous man pity some of the dinosaurs cant see the light,14,0,0.0
A blinder is an apt description of Mikes folly he needs to open his eyes Hes put himself out on a limb how long will it take for other UUP candidates to realise if they already havent that he has jeopardised their chances of getting elected If Mike remains leader until the election he will not survive much beyond that as I strongly believe the UUP will have a disastrous election Im certainly not gloating I thought he had great potential sadly hes out of touch with reality As for the dinosaurs they will be around for many years to come Unionism and Nationalism can never form a truly workable Government not when the aspirations of one side is the demise of the country they are governing,127,6,0.047244094488188976
The UUP are not a unionist party anymore how can they be when the leader nesbitt is asking the electorate to tranfer votes to the antiunionist sdlp,27,6,0.2222222222222222
I will vote for the first time in 22 years GFA aside Angry over the RHI debacle DUPs arrogance and not supporting accountability of our politicians Still too many grey people in grey suits with grey ideas of a grey future across most of the parties along with the boring sectarianism As I see it the largest Unionist party has to share power with the largest Nationalist party The UUP wants to be the largest Unionist party so it illogical to transfer votes to the DUP I presume they would also prefer to share with the SDLP rather than SF Ya falla The Union is safe in fact a United Ireland is safe Both are written in the constitution if wanted by 75 of the people That means that stance should not be the driving force of elections now It also means those who say unionists should transfer to unionists and nationalists should transfer to nationalists are only interested in entrenched ideologies and not what is best for the future of every citizen of this country Unfortunately I dont see any difference with this party and while your support of integrated education is an encouraging move forward as one of the 46 percent who dont normally vote you havent done enough to earn my first preference this time But youve still got two more weeks,225,13,0.057777777777777775

Petition Ireland Reunification Talks As part of The governments Brexit talks there should be a discussion about a possible ReUnification of Ireland As Northern Ireland will now be our only physical border with the EU some kind of border controls will have to be implemented to stop any unrestricted movement across the UK border We suggest that there is a clause that after a specified period of time say six years since we have officially left the EU the people of both Ireland  Northern Ireland can decide whether they would like their current situation to stay the same Northern Ireland to reunify with Ireland or whether The Republic of Ireland would like to rejoin the United Kingdom Click this link to sign the petition httpspetitionparliamentukpetitions176418sponsorsjlAPEwbBnqGuJd5WxKd,125,3,0.024

The UUP were always deprooted in my family as a family in North Antrim that is quite unique and like my family I embraced the UUP as the party for me I have defended them across the board against many doubters Sometimes I was commended for standing by the party by friends and sometimes I asked myself why I still do I cant speak for Loyalism as a whole but as a young Loyalist Im beginning to feel distant from the party I once apsired to Join and run for My reason for distance is an issue of class The UUP do not represent Working Class Loyalism any further than Council level It is a growing concern of mine that the UUP are happier to shack up with Middle Class Nationalists and Unionists while forgetting about and leaving the Working Class to fend for themselves without representation Unless issues like mine and others are addressed the resurrection of the UUP in Loyalist areas wont happen any time soon Nurture your roots and the tree will grow stronger What would Carson say,181,8,0.04419889502762431

Will be interested to see if other parties will choose to join the government or opposition A brave move and TBH Im surprised at this but it will be interesting to see how it works as the dup played this role to their advantage when they were in opposition to the initial agreement and ultimately gained control on the back of it with a very aggressive and fiery opposition which in truth every Ulster man buys into So short term loss for the uup could mean long term gain,89,4,0.0449438202247191

If you want my vote you must confirm the following Positive action towards integrated education  will not enter an unworkable Executive but go into Opposition  will clamp down on sectarianism by distancing Party from Orange Order influence  will back womens right to abortion for foetal abnormality rape and incense promote the reality that unionists are generally duel heritage if going back 100 years and do more to promote a cultural mix that reflects the fact that 1 million Irish born people are integrated happily into GB life  Implement Donaldson Report to fix NHS  Dont waste money on Corporation Tax reduction its pie in the sky  End the fiasco of two teacher training colleges churning out trained teachers for jobs that do not exist  Bring NI in line with UK Welfare legislation  Stop wasting police budget on policing stupid sectarian flash points  Back grammar schools and bring back technical colleges not everyone is suited to university I am one of the 50 that dont vote because no Party can match the above criteria,172,3,0.01744186046511628
