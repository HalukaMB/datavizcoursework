Genuine question How will smaller businesses afford this The only way they can compensate would be to either a increase prices which would turn people off and reduce trade b reduce staff which would increase unemployment or c pay smaller businesses a subsidy of sorts In the case of the latter where would that money come from How much would be needed How would it be distributed What measures are in place to reduce fraudulent claims Are they to be subsidised indefinitely Of course in response to this genuine question Im expecting the usual slew of insults from Corbynites so have at it folks,104,2,0.019230769230769232

Because Labour also plan to ban zero hour contracts and the likes All well and good and I fully support it in principle but when you have people working set 20 hour contracts on that wage things will start looking differently The Tories can get away with it at the moment since theyve gerrymandered unemployment figures to include those on such contracts and volunteer work The same opposition was also raised when the Tories implemented the haha national living wage Even though it was only a small increase on paper it hit quite a lot of small businesses pretty hard When you also have to pay for rent maintenance electric gas water sewerage and equipment for your business it puts wages into perspective,123,2,0.016260162601626018

It will increase their wage costs a bit but it will do it the same for everybody as long as there is some enforcement So it might have some inflationary effect in some sectors but probably not very much hour is not colossal Plenty of small businesses will be paying more than that anyway and the effect of a minimum wage will be to protect those who pay well from undercutting by those who pay badly Its also a kind of stimulus done by regulation rather than by taxnspend Increased circulation of money actually in peoples hands being spent rather than squirted into nonproductive assets like houses or exported,109,2,0.01834862385321101

There is a lot of stupidity or naivety in this post First yes we should pay people more The benefits for the economy are wellknown Theyll spend more boosting the economy and theyll also think about saving for their future taking a burden off the state in terms of pensions not to mention the savings in terms of benefits In work benefits sounds so wrong why is someone working but cant earn enough to feed their family The comments saying every business should be able to afford the rises is just ridiculous What is a business If youre thinking of Starbucks then maybe But some smaller businesses have huge staff costs look at nurseries parents are paying about the average take home salary per month just to look after one of their children Yet the nurseries are struggling and forced to pass on costs to parents They cant do much about it because they need to hire two lots of staff as shifts are very long they need to give their workers some time off for lunch etc This is an example where just changing the minimum wages creates problems The government says it wants to move from low wages high benefits to the opposite which is one of the most obvious policies to announce but important nevertheless The government must support small to medium sized businesses when they increase the minimum wage in either tax cuts or employer national insurance contributions Bigger companies such as Lidl and Aldi have led the way choosing salaries above minimum wage and closer to living wage They get their staff to be more productive and pay them well We are very unproductive around 30 less productive than our closest neighbours the French We also work more hours and have a lower minimum wage Its hard to think paying more could harm our productivity,310,7,0.02258064516129032

Peter Walsh every worker deserves a living wage Why A living wage is surely enough total income to meet a socially acceptable standard of living That is not the same as a ph minimum wage rate Try working one shift a week on ph Is that a living wage Besides plenty of low paid workers are not in households which are in poverty Often were talking about young workers living with parents on reasonable salaries or the second income for a couple or pensioners with an additional income stream These people dont really depend on the low pay to survive so much as to provide extrasLow pay may be associated with poverty but does not automatically signify it I can think of nothing I could legally do which would induce an employer to pay me the minimum wage rate Labour is proposing I just dont see the value of my output as being that high Why should an employer be forced to pay more than my worth when Im quite willing to be realistic and accept less Would you have Labour make me unemployed of forced to work illegally cash in hand This idea that businesses are failing because they cant afford to pay ph seems wrongheaded A business is failing if it cant afford to keep going Placing large onerous obstacles in their way is a sure way to trip a few up  per hour is just about a living wage for 40 hours work Haha yeah Id really struggle if I were to only have 4 times what I currently spend to live on My last employer decided that running a pub was a mugs game too The final straw for him was minimum wages rising to 20 Now he has the security of a normal job with regular pay a lot less stress and half the hours he used to work He also has just over a dozen fewer employees well actually he now has none,329,9,0.02735562310030395
Lee Tay correct me if Im wrong but are you saying you can live on a week If so you must be single living at home with a parent no car no kids and an almost non existent social life a pretty joyless existence for most people I just heard on the radio about thousands of care workers leaving the industry I think it said 900 a week because of pay and conditions Thankyou Tories you have broken not only the NHS but the Care Industry is barely able to survive now Care workers are on 69 per hour or 800 a year many are on ZHC The stress of the job is enormous and more female care workers are taking their own lives than in any other occupation What a dire situation this government has created,137,3,0.021897810218978103

Nope Over simplifying the issue,5,0,0.0
Economists can give you two different answers to the same question so lets use logic If wages go up does that create more or less disposable income More question no 2 What are companies likely to do for example supermarkets who have been involved in price wars for Id say over a decade Are they going to say mmm more money for goods and increase the prices Or will the price war simply continue as it has done so far Thats my ignorant knowledge part Now Ive gone away and researched inflation and youre looking at costpush inflation the idea that companies will pass on the cost of rising wages Yes that is a possibility in my original comment I said that we must ensure that the government introduces this in a way that doesnt affect small to medium sized businesses and I gave the example of childcare places like nurseries Childcare costs are very high and companies are struggling as there are long days requiring two lots of staff to be hired and legal limits to the number of staff per child The increased wages will increase the spend in the local economy as someone else pointed out But again as I previously mentioned it could tackle our woefully low productivity and we are around 30 less productive than French workers Even a very modest increase in productivity would help the economy greatly The reason why the government should soften the blow to SMEs is that it should fit the reducing need for in work benefits which is a long term structural issue that would be worth funding for at least 3 years Employer NI is possibly the easiest way to offer a rebate and allow them to keep their staff and hire more if they want to The government subsises wages anyway There is a deliberate refusal of many to analyse the pros and cons There are issues with this policy but my proposal is hopefully one answer to the main drawback and that leaves well I could probably name 5 huge benefits this policy would bring,349,8,0.022922636103151862

Ok let me explain how this works Now I am going over simplify it but the outcome and point remain the same When you pay people a living wage that they can actually live on So that they dont have to worry about paying the rent putting food on the table and paying other bills The have more disposable income Now guess what they do with that disposable income They save some and they spend some Guess where they spend it Mostly in their local small businesses So therefor the profits of those businesses go up Which in turn means they can afford to pay their employees more while still turning a profit Thats basically how it works Go look at places that pay a living wage now a real one And you will see not only does it benefit the employees but it also benefits the economy over all Now their are other things that need to go hand in hand with a living wage to ensure it works First of close all the tax loopholes and Havens and claw back the billions we are owed in unpaid taxes Secondly tie that living wage to the rate of inflation with incremental changes depending on where you live so that you are always able to live on that wage Thirdly rent controls To ensure that greedy landlords can rip off their tenants by jacking up rents By creating a real living wage and following the above steps then everybody wins But the only way any of that happens is by voting for jc and labour ADDENDUM One more point I would like to add We also need to RE work our system of taxation To ensure that it is fair representative and proportionate The current system is massively unfair with those least able to afford it shouldering the majority of the fiscal responsibility While those who can afford to pay more try and do every trick and twist in the book to pay as little as they can get away with And it appears to me as if those in society who are the most well of are the same ones who pay the least amount of tax,368,5,0.01358695652173913

Xander Jack Skatington Davis I dont understand what there is to get Im not an economist Im not even very good with maths But to me this is just common sense There has been a massive redistribution of wealth from the poorest in our society to the wealthiest Its time to redress the balance People in full time employment should not have make a choice between eating and heating The only reason why a living wage is not a thing now is because of the greed and opulence of a few Whos only goal is to accumulate as much wealth and power as they can It just goes to show how far the rot has set in and how well spun the lies are that people can even suggest that a living wage is a bad idea In fact in a true democracy they would be protesting in the streets to demand it But we do not live in a democracy we live in an oligarch ran by and for the benefit of the rich,175,6,0.03428571428571429

Wouldnt dream of slagging off any small business support the working man at the risk of repeating myself again I dont think for one second Corbyn would wish to put the small business man on the dole after all currently they are the mainstay of the economy My understanding is the wage would be subsidised by the government or another way to pay the living wage is force the tax dodging corporations into paying what they are supposed to If you think back when the minimum wage was first discussed everyone was up in arms saying loads of businesses would go to the wall Yes some did but that was probably because of the exterminate interest rates charged by banks etc the ridiculous business rates high rents the hike on VAT Getting back to your original question I dont want the small business man to be out of pocket but I do want people to be paid a living wage Sorry keep adding to this but in America where they are facing similar economic struggles to this country many states have voted for the 15 dollar an hour minimum wage The final thing is I worked as a one man band and it wasnt easy but I made a living until breast cancer took over then the tax man vat man took the rest including my house,227,6,0.02643171806167401
The problem i have got with Mr Corbyn and his  Advisors  whoever they may be is that they have promised so much to the electorate but have NOT given any indication of how any of the promised projects will be financed Try running a small business in one of the most deprived areas of Britain where we are forced to pay higher rents and rates than London for our premises  Add that to the rising costs of Fuel Insurance Heat and Light Wages Etc Then try to pass the extra costs to your customers ,94,4,0.0425531914893617

Labour can promise a minimum wage of an hour for all the difference it makes Under Corbyn they have no hope of getting into government Possibly coherent policies and a strategy of how to engage with the media instead of constant tweets and Facebook updates and temper tantrums from Corbyn when hes asked difficult questions might make them electable Because without being in power they are an irrelevance,68,4,0.058823529411764705

One way of looking at that issue is to release that foreign workers dont know laws and regulations I suspect also that British workers dont know laws and regulations either So we might assert that it would be vital before taking up employment to know these laws that govern work practices If you dont then how can you expect not to be exploited,63,3,0.047619047619047616

Pushing wages up artificially like this is just dumb It will make British businesses less competitive in an international market just when we need to be competitive Far better to bring public transport social housing energy water and broadband back into publicstate hands so that the prices can be more affordable and people dont need higher wages to be able to afford the basics Duty on fuel and council tax should be reduced too As a Labour Party member I cant support a simplistic increase in wages like this It makes no sense to me We need to be more supportive of businesses that employ people An efficient benefits system is needed more than that would allow the labour market to be more flexible which would be better for our economy But a benefit system that takes months to process claims does no favours to employers and employees alike,149,2,0.013422818791946308
Ive written about this before but you cannot get businesses to go along with this and even if you could staff get pressed to do higher targets greater workload and the cost is also put onto the consumer This is a case yet again of politicians dwellling in their gated leafy suburbs thinking up plans and ways to sate their own vanity projects You cannot have adult families working on minimum wage jobs They were designed as entry level jobs for school leavers single young men and boys to gain skills and get a bit of money They were touted as career jobs though A minimum wage job was never meant to be a wage you can bring a family up on and hence why there was a push for tax credits and so forth Eventually as the State shrinks this wlll be pulled asunder and families wont take the jobs because they just dont pay and they are not meant to either,163,4,0.024539877300613498
Another problem with raising the minimum wage like this is that it puts pressure on companies to maintain the wage differentials between different skill levels of their workforce Its not just those at the bottom who they have to pay more Just allowing the lowest earners wages to creep up isnt good for producyivity higher up the payskill scale because people simply wont work for the same rate as people who are less skilled than them John Lewis is widely regarded as being a good employer but this would cripple them,91,3,0.03296703296703297

James Jennings its not a question of showing loyalty its voting for what you believe to be the best for the people who voted you in and sticking to socialist policies the likes of blair and kinnock only voted for whats best for themselves and abandonded socailist policy I supported kinnock when he was elected leader and felt he was hard done by how wrong I was look at the shithouse he turned into,74,7,0.0945945945945946
David John can i ask pal why dont you try get a leader that can bring you those policies and win  as a blairite i understand that the members want more socialist policies  that it cant go back to blairite policies  i dont get why you corbyn guys cant understand you need sensible policies on defence  immigration  unions  i really like some of his policies but those last 3 are deal breakers for most people  if i was the left id be thinking lets get another left wing leader in the party might unite behind  because if this goes to an election and we are wiped out the left are finished,111,10,0.09009009009009009
James Jennings the blairites will never unite behind a left wing leader compromise works both ways,16,1,0.0625
David John yes they would we all would because if he comprimised on defence immigration unions etc he would be electable  i no you guys dont want to admit it he cant win and THEY lose there jobs why should they be quiet if they genuinly believe backed up now by polls and bye election results  that hes going to destroy the party so they lose there seats,68,6,0.08823529411764706
James Jennings how can you say they would compromise with a left wing leader when they have already stabbed him in the back they are not compromising on any of his policies as for backup by the polls and by elections the polls are all paid for by people who dont want labour to win  and his record on by elections is good he is not destroying the party they are after all he is the leader and has been voted in twice thats a good enough mandate for anyone,90,2,0.022222222222222223
David John kinnock was elected twice did it help him win  no did corbyn and the left get behind kinnock because he was voted in twice  and the polls were spot on in copeland and stoke and richmond  unless your dumb and you dont seem to be you no full well the significance of losing seats to govs in mid tearms it hasnt happened since the 80s in a situation like copeland the 60s  so if your right and the polls are wrong we sould do well at the council elections  and if im right we will be crushed  so we will see  and you talk about comprimise iv told you loads what comprimises we would be willing to make  not once have i heard you say how the left would be willing to comprimise because you no full well you wont,142,18,0.1267605633802817

When Beveridge published the report in 1942 he was a veteran civil servant who had been sidelined during the war effort The report was widely distributed amongst the public and was even sent to soldiers on the frontlines  and its publication catapulted Beveridge into the public arena Speaking to large audiences in the aftermath of the report the popular support he whipped up during his brief political career ensured that whichever government took charge after the war ended would have to implement his ideas,84,3,0.03571428571428571

Hes only unelectable because of our in fighting No disagreement with Corbyn stretches well beyond the confines of an infighting Labour party It seems like Labour are making few gains among the rest of the electorate surly for you haters any Labour is better that Tory Possibly but when this Labour will drive the party further from power then a DIFFERENT Labour is better than THIS Labour Hence the infighting to get rid of the current leadership What would be the effect of the whole party getting behind the current leadership Wouldnt it just create the impression that the whole of the party was out to lunch rather than just the current leadership That would be even more damaging to public perceptions Besides the rest of the PLP have equally firmly held political beliefs Surely it is easier for the few on the leftmost fringes of Labour politics to compromise their views than for 180 or 200 MPs to abandon their beliefs and feign support for a programme they dont believe in,172,5,0.029069767441860465

Many people of my age at nearly 60 and older will appreciate how hard it was to being a young working adult High unemployment and poor wagesbut over time through unions and better cooperation with employers we finally had a fighting chancebut since the early 80s to the present day the torys have reversed all of this with smashing unions and obliterating all major industrys to where we have no major employment for the working classeswe have arrived at low payed unskilled workzero hours contracts and mass migration of people from eastern Europe who are willing to work for low payresulting in a standards of living deteriorating and I feel we are drifting towards yet again the employers calling all the shots and we the working class going back to the old days of the cap in hand erawe can see this but the young people cant until its too latethats why we need a modern labour party that can deliver and truly represent the ordinary people the back bone of this country before we are dragged back to the dark ages,182,11,0.06043956043956044

Laurie Armitt Mr Corbyns record of voting with the party over his whole 34yrs is 896 It was only so low during the BlairBrown years because of issues of illegal wars privatisation of the NHS destruction of the social housing system All mistakes we are now paying for The Tories have supercharged those mistakes to the extent that this country is citied as inhuman by the UN We need a Labour Government who will own up and fix those mistakes as well as one that will promote al the good things the LP have always stood for Until Mr Corbyns 2015 election that was not even on the agenda Only way is to vote labour or let the Tories win,120,6,0.05
Sadly I think youre seeing things a little coloured by momentum The choice for the NHS when labour was in power was to either let the private sector invest in the infrastructure or let it deteriorate to what we see now with the tories While I dont think it was the best thing to happen to our greatest public service I think it was a choice between new hospitals or crumbling ones As for the housing sector I think youre bashing new labour with the crime of the Tories of the right to buy scheme I wish New labour could have curtailed this short term policy but it is likely to be a vote loser Ultimately I dont think you and I disagree with policy or ideals Unfortunately I think we disagree with our ideas of how to get things implemented As much as it may pain a labour supporter to admit it you have to win the support of liberals and tories if you want to win elections That means broadening your appeal Thats what new labour understood sadly not what Jeremy gets You have to make decisions you have to have convictions to get to power You cant simply slump your shoulders and blame everyone else or give vague answers You have to let the people know what you stand for and come out all guns blazing when the government is doing a shabby job I could be mistaken but not once have I heard him raise the illegitimacy of this government or the fact that they have borrowed more money than the labour government they have criticised for being fiscally irresponsible We are in opposition we should be opposing,282,7,0.024822695035460994
Laurie Armitt Oh Laurie Party member and union rep for over 33yrs I am a Cooperative Party member  if you understand what that means 1 No there were always other ways to invest in the NHS than PFI  which currently means that 2040 of the budget of each and every NHS Trust in country goes in PFI debt 2 I worked in housing and homelessness for over 20yrs  and RTB was tory and disastrous but the LP did not stop it did not build in the public sector introduced increasing gatekeeping measures to deny people legal rights to public housing increased use of the private sector for statutory cases  thereby transferring the cost onto the HB bill and allowing the explosion of profiteering by private landlord 3 There is nothing in the Corbyn policy agenda that does not have a broad appeal  And there is a full policy agenda  Which as a member you should know No one is simply slumping your shoulders and blame everyone else or give vague answers 4 34 uturns by a government in under 18 months is unprecedented  you are mistaken about Mr Corbyns not challenging both the legitimacy of this government and their borrowing  again maybe you are not listening In PMQs  Mrs Mays only form of attack is the policies of the BlairBrown government  which Corbyn defends 5 He is opposing  Mr Blair particularly with his deregulation of banks  not only did not oppose  he positively promoted the continuation of Tory monetarism whilst in office,252,17,0.06746031746031746
Sadly that is the state of the Labour Party Everyone aligned to Jeremy is determined to defend him to the hilt The fact that the party is the worst its been polling for decades means nothing as long as Jerome is in power Labour is more than and always has been more than one person We can argue about what new labour did the point is look at what is happening to our country now Why arent labour raising the point that the tories are borrowing more now than new labour ever did Why arent we seriously opposing the most important change to our constitution by a potentially illegitimate government Why is there speculation that democratically elected MPs can be deselected by johnny come lately labour members rather than the constituents that voted them in Weve become a shambles You can delude yourself all you want Theres no denying Ed miliband even polled better than Jeremy Corbyn at the same stage If youve been a labour supporter for as long as you say you have to accept that we can only change things if we are in government We are in no shape to do that If thats what youre happy with then I cant agree with you Sorry,209,10,0.04784688995215311
Laurie Armitt Laurie the party is an appalling because a very vocal fraction is more concerned with undermining Corbyn than fighting the Tories it is that simple It is about more than one person  it is about policy The LP are raising the point that the Tories are borrowing more now than the LP ever did If you do not want to say the word Brexit  lets get it out  Corbyn is right I do not like that Leave won but every party and every party leader said before the vote they would honour the outcome  what type of Brexit is a different matter  there is a whole slew of parliamentary legal and stakeholder avenues in order to shape Brexit over the next 2yrs and the LP have been and are working on them all On mandatory reselection andor deselection for cause these are party policy and local CLP matters  always have been The LP is a Shambles and only Corbyn is keeping it together Ed Miliband suffered Coups of his own and then was hobbled by the most awful election campaign ever  this was lead by Progress in fact it was the reason Progress was set up  LP members and TUs dared to elect EdM  who was too left for Lord Sainsbury So he withdrew his funding from the LP in general and only funded those who signed up to his new organisation I agree the LP needs to get into power but both the campaigns of EdM and Brown proved that the old  tell the public anything then do what we think is right and make excuses for a lack of political courage  was not going to work anymore That way lost us Scotland and the Labour Heartlands  I know I was there Getting into shape to fight the next election is being hampered party infighting and it has to stop NB in 3 of your postings now you have used the term deluded and made assumptions about my political leanings  you might want to think on that Peace Out,342,24,0.07017543859649122

Well said Cathy Its shameful the people that seem proud to say they have supported Labour all their lives but apparently support Murdoch and the right wing at the same time Being a Labour Party member is about being confident about our leader and of who we are and what policies we support I am 100,56,0,0.0
Im sorry Angela you know nothing about me To suggest I support Rupert Murdoch because I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn is the typical rubbish thats been levelled at anyone who dares have an opinion contrary to the leadership What happened to wanting the Labour Party to be more democratic Doesnt that mean listening to all opinions regardless of whether they are in line with your thinking In the same way Jeremy was allowed to dissent to the party line when he was a back bencher why cant labour supporters have different views to Jeremy now without the fear of being called right wing and not real labour supporters,108,4,0.037037037037037035

So you want to fund somewhat unnecessary opportunities for state school children by taking away from those who go private I dont understand why private school parents should be essentially triple taxed National Insurance for state council tax for local authority and your proposed VAT that goes where to pay for lunches for those who can afford them Why not have the schools set up a lunch ticket system that parents add money to if not on free lunches so that no one knows who is getting help Its an easy way to eliminate the potential stigma at all age levels and it costs very little,106,1,0.009433962264150943
Currently the system of FSM involves the parents being willing to give permission to have their financial records checked with HMRC 3 times per year by supplying their NINOs and signing an audit document And there are some very poor families who fall through this if their benefit claims are not up to date something which happens a worryingly  of the time Universal benefits or other provisions are easier and cheaper to administer It is also a matter of having the funding to provided an good meal service across the board Nobody it taking anything away from those who go private  except money,103,3,0.02912621359223301
Money is something Its a way to punish those who go private many of whom are middle class or self employed working class Labour is shooting themselves in the foot by alienating a group that has supported them or might have done so I have voted Labour since I was eligible to vote but this policy is seriously shifting me to the Lib Dems The idea of free lunches for all is good but the funding plan needs to be adjusted The way that Labour is downplaying it in their communications with party supporters makes it clear that they know this,101,1,0.009900990099009901
Monica Gilbert Taxes are not punishment Being forced into taking exploitative jobs at wages that mean even if you work 48hrs a week you are still reliant on benefits now thats punishment The cost of a private school is just that and people can chose to pay it or not This policy  which is the same as the Lib Dems policy would shift you to the Libdems The LP are not downplaying the financing of the policy it is there front and centre  and actually people like it,88,5,0.056818181818181816

Ive heard nothing about the Lib Dems funding it through private school taxes but I will look into it,19,2,0.10526315789473684
Monica Gilbert People who pay for private education do so because they want to give their children advantages over other peoples children If they do that it is their choice but they should not complain about having to pay twice By turning their backs on the state system they are creating a divided society and not contributing their interest and support to state schools and good education for all In Bristol a city with many private schools state schools have a smaller top end because so many parents chose to go private When research exists to show that a strong top end helps all students to rise this is a matter of real concern Finally consider that most countries do not have a significant number of private schools and are happy to see all their children educated together These comprehensive systems deliver far better outcomes for all children Britain by comparison fares quite poorly,154,0,0.0
Judith Kinsman Then how do we ensure that there are enough quality state school places for all the children especially in London and the Southeast And if we eliminated the removal of the top end to be more in line with other countries some of which like Japan have state secondary schools primarily assigned by ability much like the grammar school system how would we fund the free lunches for all primary students I just dont think VAT on fees for the sole purpose of funding school lunches makes sense If VAT is applied there are other areas of need in the state educational sector supplies teachers TAs building repairs additional classrooms the arts etc Thats where the idea of private schools giving back makes more sense,127,5,0.03937007874015748

Im sorry to say Corbyn is just not doing it His heart is in the right place but hes not a part leader Hes failing in his challenge of May on a weekly basis and dont get me started on Dianne Abbott,42,5,0.11904761904761904
So who do you suggest instead given that labour have only had about 6 leaders since the 1800s that have actually won a general election and they had the advantage of the Scottish vote and replacing corbyn with someone more conservative certainly isnt bringing that backCorbyn is by far the most popular person they have Replacing him would in my opinion reduce the amount of votes they receive in a general election He may not win but very few other labour leaders have done so either and I cant remember anyone being so persistent with this line with other leaders Its not like they have had a winning record in the past Who is this magic candidate that people think will do better than corbyn come election time And if corbyn is replaced and the new leader still fails to win then what May as well let him have his turn,151,6,0.039735099337748346

Jeff I agree with you 100 Percent we all know how his values sound good on paper but as a leader he is a complete waste of time maybe he needs people around him to tell HIM the truth It reminds how the people around Stalin were afraid to speak out He needs to go ASAP so people can elect a new leader if he loved the Labour party has he makes out he should save it by going Now Plenty of good people who could do better than him,90,0,0.0

Paul Nugent Yeah because thats totally how life works Whatever a persons situation is like at the point they think hey were in a comfortable situation were in love shall we try to have children to the point when said child or children is at primary school will obviously stay exactly the same or improve Its not like things like redundancies unemployment zero hour contracts mental health problems unavoidable circumstances unfortunate events and god knows what else cant rear their ugly heads and lead people who may have once financially been well off to be in a position where they are struggling The Conservatives Facebook page is that way if thats the kind of tripe you believe ,117,3,0.02564102564102564

Im not sure why some people are missing some obvious points but 1 This policy would remove the stigma of free school meals Just google free school meals bullying and see the large numbers of children that are apparently bullied for receiving free school meals There are also lots of reports that state numerous parents who are entitled to free school meals for their children do not apply for it because of the concerns their child will be bullied 2 The Governments current policy does not go far enough The Huffington Post reports that approx 700000 children living in poverty are not entitled to free school meals That is a disgrace,111,3,0.02702702702702703
if youre willing to commit to that amount of money then you should be willing to pay the VAT as well Why If you provide all the private sector parents with a cheque to the value of the cost of a state sector school place perhaps there is a reasonable case for applying VAT State schools dont pay VAT either Why should state educated pupils gain a tax advantage If the point is that the private sector grants non universal benefits to a privileged group who partake of it then you have to consider whether we should apply VAT to university tuition fees too,104,2,0.019230769230769232

Have you not read the latest report on how less able children who attend private schoolsand who have poorer results than those in state schools STILL go on to have far better jobs than a clevererstate educated person This is NOT fair and so lets do away with private schools  allow afair playing field for ALL our children You appear simply interested in an influx into state educationandyes initially this would cause a problembut in a democratic societyits a far fairer policy with the best allowed to rise to the topNot whom your parents know allocating you a top position,100,7,0.07
Melissa J Roberts No Ive not read the report but it sounds entirely consistent with pushy parents with financial muscle being able to provide more for their dim kids than ordinary parents of more intelligent kids Youre not going to end that by getting rid of private schools Those parents will still be able to pay for private tutors summer crammers encourage more factual based TV viewing habits go to museums and other culturally enriching activities in holidays buy more books have more enlightening dinner table conversations etc Im not quite sure why youd wish to prevent any parent from acting in what they think is their childs best interest If you want to address the unfair advantages some kids gain from being born to the right parents start with taxing parents on income and wealth not penalising them for making decisions about how they wish to spend posttax incomes because they dont fit in with Labour state is best ethos My main concern is that I dont see why the state should be paying more to support some kids than others except say in cases of illness and disability As it stands the state pays around pa to educate kids in the public system whereas the kids in the private system dont receive this public spending It seems a bit much to then ask that the parents of privately educated kids to pay for the dinners of kids who are already getting a much better deal from the state than their own kids are I quite like the idea of universal benefits but this policy doesnt do that There are no free lunches for secondary school kids the packed lunchers or the home educated or the privately educated If you want to achieve universal benefits set child benefit for all kids at a level sufficient to pay for a kids basic survival Dont start with policies only benefitting those who are of the right age make the right decision as to what sort of school to attend and are prepared to be fed state gruel As I mentioned above the biggest effects of this policy do not seem to be alleviation of hunger or removal of stigma but a transfer of wealth to the parents of primary school kids who already pay for school dinners,386,15,0.038860103626943004

Labour are sounding increasingly irrational Some insight is needed into the psychology of poverty When you are poor motivation goes out of the window Of course you know what a good diet is but instead you feel down and just crave salty fatty spicy and sweet foods They feel nice and make you feel good As a parent its a lot easier giving your kids crisps a pasty or chips than cooking a meal from scratch Any of us who have been in that situation know you really just want to pig out on something nice  Fruit and salad does not do that for you Some families have been living like that for years and have lost all motivation The way to tackle that though in not to give every child of primary school age a free meal every day We know that bikes are healthy for kids They encourage exercise and fight obesity but we would never consider buying a bike for every childWhat we should be doing is getting parents into work building their skills and qualifications and raising their income levels Then strangely people start wanting to do the right thing abour have stopped thinking with insight They are just churning out 1940 solutions Th problems back then were different,213,2,0.009389671361502348
Following on from the CleggCameron introduction of free meals to infants already in place it seems they are in good company,21,1,0.047619047619047616
Hi Helen If memory serves that policy was the big win for the LibDems in the coalition and Cameron was happy to buy them off with it because it didnt mean very much It was implemented in 2014 and Im not aware of any studies done on possible benefits or other impacts It would seem obvious that a malnourished child would achieve better at school if you feed him or her but thats not a reason to give free school meals to every other child of primary school age in the country It was petulant politics on behalf of the Labour Party Making rich families pay for starving kids meals On the day of the launch the policy was not available from the party and as far as I know thats still the case It was timed for the local elections at the start of May This is not the way a grown up party makes policy that would cost million plus a yearLabour has just lost my daughters vote as a consequence and I suspect a lot of others,180,6,0.03333333333333333

While this sounds like a great idea on the surface I think its really quite terrible Many families can afford school lunches so they dont need government subsidies The stigma associated with receiving free or reduced lunches can be eliminated by using a ticket system either paper tickets or electronic systems parents pay into if needed so that students cant tell who paid what Even upgrading to an electronic system would be significantly cheaper than funding all the lunches Also it is unfair to fund this through taxes on private school fees I can tell you for a fact that there are many parents sacrificing a great deal to send their child to private schools They are already funding state schools through National Insurance and council tax contributions so they should not essentially be triple taxed It feels as if you are punishing those who choose not to use the state school route And with how oversubscribed many state schools are the worst thing would be to tax children out of the private sector and into the state And would private primary schools receive state funding for their meals if you want all children regardless of income to receive hot meals then youd have to do this,207,2,0.00966183574879227
These people however aspirational choose to send their children to private schools A private school is a forprofit business protected by charitable status How is that fair What would you say if I bought a 6 litre sports car and then complained that my car only got 6 MPG and the VED was too high Would you feel OK about me getting a taxbreak on the VED because I work really hard,72,4,0.05555555555555555
That comparison is not the same VED is to discourage people from buying cars that use more fuel The comparison only works if you are admitting that this plan is really to discourage people from sending children to private school And those sending children to private education are still funding state schools through their taxes I could understand an additional tax if they arent UK residents but otherwise it is double or triple taxation,74,2,0.02702702702702703
Zero rate VAT is supposed to be on essential goods or services I am at a loss as why the VAT exemption applied to school fees in the first place,30,0,0.0
VED is no such thing VED is a pollution tax pure and simple Its not meant to discourage anybody Its an acknowledgment that some cars are dirtier than others and that its more expensive in terms of cleanup and health costs to own one Rather than pass those costs on to every tax payer by adding to fuel duty or whatever the person with the car is given the choice to pay the expenses or buy a less polluting car If you choose the bigger car you pay more because it pollutes more You have the choice to either pay the fees or buy a smaller car If you choose to have a more polluting car you dont then expect a tax break because the car costs you more in tax Or perhaps you do,135,5,0.037037037037037035
Paul Lerwill So VED is to account for the additional costs the government accrues due to your choice However private school children save the government money They dont have to pay the educational costs for that child leaving more money per child in that local authority of course the amounts still might not be sufficient due to austerity cuts but thats another issue The VED comparison doesnt fit From my understanding the government is expecting private schools to provide services to the community as part of their not for profit status Opening up facilities for the community and state schools to use Allowing state school pupils to attend undersubscribed specialist classes in secondary school or sending those specialist teachers into the state schools Allowing state school students to participate in some of the extracurricular activities Offering state school teachers the opportunity to attend training days or offering training days at state schools Offering bursaries to low income students in the community Or even sponsoring a state school that is switching to academy status These seem like more suitable expectations for private schools that will benefit the educational experiences of the state school pupils If private schools are expected to add value to the community in exchange for their tax exempt status then a tax cannot be added to the fees,220,7,0.031818181818181815

From pages 150151 of the report cited in evidence by Angela Raynor in support of this scheme available at httpswwwgovukgovernmentuploadssystemuploadsattachmentdatafile184047DFERR227pdf The universal pilot approach cost 1 million in Newham and 6 million in Durham equivalent to around per primary school pupil per year Of this 32 per cent in Newham and 46 per cent in Durham was deadweight cost that is involved paying for meals that would otherwise have been paid for by parents Other initiatives targeting similar outcomes such as the Jamie Oliver Feed Me Better campaign appeared to be able to deliver significant impacts at substantially lower cost If 46 of the money spent on the scheme in Durham chosen because it was an area of high deprivation was effectively spending not on improving nutritional standards in schools but increasing the disposable incomes of parents whose children already ate school meals how much more will be wasted in areas of average or even high levels of affluence Why should parents who are already saving the public purse the cost of a school place be expected to raise the incomes of ordinary parents up and down the country by charging VAT on top of what they pay already so they get to feed all primary school kids One of the key features of the current system is that it enables teachers to identify children who receive free school meals who may also need help and due consideration in other areas of school life Free school meals for all means this marker is lost to teachers who will be less able to bear individual circumstances in mind in their dealings with and approach to kids The policy is nuts It seems more about class war and poorly thought through redistribution than it is about improving child nutrition,297,5,0.016835016835016835

And before making an offthecuff snide smug remark you should actually read and understand what was said Simon Casualties were kept to an absolute minimum Far more children were chemically killed  the reason for this warning That using chemical weapons will not be tolerated by a civilised societyNow I hope and believe things will not escalate Russia has indicated as much But the bigger issue is people cannot believe Jeremy Corbyn is a strong leader because he simply does not understand that some people are horrible individuals He is incredibly nieve And senior members of the Labour Party disagree with him Nothing new thereIt is sad to see Labour lurch to the far left and expect to win an election The public I feel will not vote for somebody that they see as from the past and is seen as weak no matter that I think Jeremy has some fine qualities That is why it was suggested to call a snap election by a certain Conservative  William Haig Because he thought they would wipe out Labour That will be the case sadly weither we have a General Election now or futher down the road The Conservatives are as usual ripping up their Manifesto and doing what ever they want  and had previously denied Raising NI and so on In past years it was VATAnd unfortunately we have a leader who is unable to capitalize on these opportunities,237,9,0.0379746835443038

Excellent speech from Bolivian member of UN Security Council saying while they were setting up an investigation into the gas attack in Syria and working on a response representing all members of the UN Trump was launching a unilateral attack which threatens the delicate negotiations being made to get Russia and China on board in condemning Assad This stupid man has once again made the USA the policeman of the world acting on emotion and personal hubris rather than reason and rationality Of course we are all horrified by this attack but there is as yet no evidence to say who launched it I urge everyone to listen to the speech on catch up Compare and contrast the words of this intelligent man with the stupid blundering actions of the big playground bully Trump,134,0,0.0

Simon Snaize first of all your sweeping statement that Ive been told to care I find simply moronic I guess we shall just sit back and let more of the same from Russian bombs and Assads SARIN to kill more children To do nothing and watch is a war crime in its self when you have the capacity to do something But hey ho as long as it doesnt effect you,71,5,0.07042253521126761

Im not ignoring anything Assad is a murderer Russia is implicit Difference is that I also take into account that coalition forces have killed more civilians than Russia or Syria in the last month Intensifying the assaults is going to kill more civilians My answer is to find an option that kills less rather than more civilians Your answer is that Russia and Syria wont pay attention so intensify attacks You dont protect civilians by intensifying bombing around them,79,2,0.02531645569620253

Again youre talking about it like we arent killing MORE civilians than Syria and Russia We are the ones terrorising the civilians I am not sure how you make the jump in your mind to condemn Assad with one breath and give your blessing to us killing even more civilians than we are already doing Its got nothing to do with politics Its basic humanitarianism Have a look at how life was for those in Syria before the coalition started dropping bombs on them If you actually care about the civilians and not just the rhetoric from western powers do some research,102,2,0.0196078431372549

A former British ambassador in Syria has expressed an excellent dispassionate and rational point of view on the situation of chemical weapons attack in Syria Without evidence and with no research the media has launched their psychological warfare on people to make them back another catastrophic adventure by the West in that region The CIA and associates in Europe are vastly experienced in creating the kind of narrative they are publicizing everywhere now Many politicians from different sides have readily come to back the USA and their aggressive stand Syrias huge oil and gas reserves have attracted the interests of Turkey and Qatar intend to build a gaseoduct through Syrias territory to provide gas to Europe the dominant powers in the European Union in order to reduce their dependence on Russian gas and together with the USA as a way of overcoming the lingering crisis they are suffering Furthermore Syria is a strategically geopolitical centre for the control of trade towards Africa Asia and Europe Syria is key to control the whole of the region and their oil and gas reserves,181,3,0.016574585635359115

The BBC are a onesided news reporting organization I have determined over the last 5decades They reported today the negative side of people who gathered for a stop the war demonstration a democratic right of the people to do such things when politicians can endanger the lives of their loved ones in any military confrontation But other than say this the BBC took the view that a Syrian refugee was opposed by the group This again shows that the BBC is not the true news but a propaganda machine for a bad government that did not even investigate to obtain unequivocal evidence not just photos showing the white helmets pulling socalled victims out of the rubble straight after the attack that released the chemicals Indeed the British and US governments only assume and where if Sarin had been used why were not the white helmets wearing complete medical and chemical warfare sealed suits or even gloves or masks as Sarin according to the WHO only takes a pinhead droplet to kill a human and is over 20times more deadly than cyanide If the BBC reported these facts as well they would have a balanced view of the outside world but they never do having observed their news reporting for over 50 years The people need the truth and both sides of the coin BBC and you as a socalled independent news outlet should know that So why are you not doing it War as we know is the most destructive of all human activities and Jeremy is right in questioning such retaliatory action May on the other hand just accepts what the US administration says and she acts as their political poodle That is not we want in a PM and another reason why the man of reasonableness Jeremy Corbyn will make a far safer and better prime minister than May For once war is effective it is very hard to stop as history has shown us all who are old enough to witness such death and destruction that war unleashes And we know also that ministers and politicians who are always safe and nowhere near the carnage of war do not lose their lives in fighting for socalled democracy and their perceived threats but normal working and middle class people who account for 90 of the makeup of the British people Jumping to conclusions something is not adding up in Idlib chemical weapons attack  httpswwwalmasdarnewscomarticlejumpingconclusionssomethingnotaddingidlibchemicalweaponsattack Fake News  False Flag Chemical Attacks In Syria  httpyournewswirecomfakenewsfalseflagchemicalattacksinsyria Dr David Hill CEO World Innovation Foundation,422,13,0.030805687203791468

The Syrian Regime has been regularly using Chlorine Barrel Bombs released by helicopters There is no doubt I trust the MSF medics  white helmet witnesses that Sarin was used in the recent attack and that is delivered by aircraft launched ordnance or gun shell ordnance as the Sarin weapons are based on mixing the final precursors in the weapon after launch That probably explains the use of two chemical weapons at the same time The real issue for me is not that the Syrian regime would use such weapons they have a long record of doing so but they declared with Russian support that they had destroyedremoved their stockpile of chemical weapons So either they have retained undeclared stocks of chemical weapons in breach of agreed even by Russia UN resolutions or have acquired new stocks if so from where There is no evidence that backs up the Russians claim that a weapons store was hit and the pattern and distribution of casualties does not support that hypothesis either The UN Security Council has consistently failed to protect the people of Syria mainly because of Russian  Chinese vetos of resolutions We have to find a UN solution including a UN Chapter VII Article 42  51 intervention by a UN force if necessary At the very least an arms embargo needs to be put in place and the allegations of war crimes referred to the International Criminal Court,237,5,0.02109704641350211

Until the quality of school meals is addressed then offering free meals to all really is a waste of money My son was a great eater until he entered school at age 4 Now Im making sandwiches every day and hes a picky eater  he blames school meals for this Many schools do not have the facilities to cook on site and this is probably one of the main contributors to the food served Extra taxes raised for schools I have no issue with how that money is spent I do Please listen to the headteachers on this one as to what would work for their schools  schools are as individual as the pupils attending them My son attends a rural CofE Primary in Worcestershire,125,3,0.024

Poverty is the root cause driving this policy and currently I believe we do have free school meals for people meeting certain criteria Has this benefit been changed by the Conservative Party I have thankfully never had to use this benefit so I hope that for families who do that theyre able to access it I dont think that the quality will improve anytime soon for schools with off site caterers,71,3,0.04225352112676056

Gordon I know all about poverty as I was brought up on it I can still taste what poverty feels like My parents benefited from a council house but not anything else Whilst I appreciate your comments about poorer children fitting in and I speak from experience I cant bring myself to agree with a policy to add unnecessary cost which as some of the other comments here have agreed with with food paid for quite possibly going uneaten because it is so awful For children receiving free school meals there should be discretion shown by the schools At my sons school all meals are prepaid anyway or paid in arrears so no child should be aware of whos paying,120,1,0.008333333333333333
The system as it is is pretty good If it needs to be extended to capture more kids in poverty than that is absolutely fair But a sweeping system that allows free meals for all is crazy when there are many fundamental issues at hand in education,47,0,0.0
Jane Williams i think the issue is that you only qualify for free school meals if you dont work at all if you are on a low income but receive working tax credit you are not entitled to free school meals if you are on a very low wage this can still make the situation tight for some families,59,2,0.03389830508474576

The way I see it crummy parenting and laziness is often prevalent in those who grew up with little education and low selfesteem Its all very well saying that its up to the parents to provide for their children but theyre not always going to break the cycle of poor parenting handed down through generations off their own backs Getting through to the youngest of generations educating them on how to behave and be valuable members of society regardless of their upbringing and social status is the way to ensure that future generations dont fall back on living on handouts through choice or resorting to criminality If their parents are going to be useless then the schools should at least inspire them to want to follow a brighter alternative path and to show them how to access it Im not sure offering school meals to all children is necessary and it should probably be means tested however I do like the idea that children whose parents are failing them could be nurtured and fed properly Any decent human being wants that for a child even if its not their own I really think class sizes need to come down too and that more vocational subjects could be offered for those that arent as academically minded If a kid isnt enjoying what theyre doing and they have no other options available to them then naturally they just give up on even trying to learn which is where the system fails them,250,7,0.028

Well firstly this isnt an entirely new idea because in England the Government already provides free school meals for children in the first 3 years of primary school the Labour scheme would just be extending this to the end of primary Secondly theyre not proposing to take any extra money from taxpayers directly to fund it instead they want to start charging VAT to private schools who currently dont pay it Most importantly though how can it be justified to oppose this on the grounds that irresponsible parents dont deserve it Lots of people upthread have given reasons why struggling to pay for school meals can be difficult but even if this wasnt the case and that parents were just feckless how can you say that youd prefer the children to suffer and be punished for something thats entirely beyond their control,142,8,0.056338028169014086

As someone with a moderate sized garden who grows their own veggies the outlay often costs more than the cost of buying the veg from the supermarket Also unless we dedicated ourselves fulltime and using every inch of garden we would never be able to entirely meet our own consumption needs We are also looking into keeping chickens and again even without the cost of the coop feeding and cleaning costs make it cheaper to buy eggs from the supermarket unless I start a mini battery farm and squeeze in 30 at a time and kill them every year for meat again another fulltime occupation Its the same with making my own clothes the cost of fabrics and notions make it much cheaper to buy from the high street In fact I often buy a cheap items from Primark just for the Zipsbuttons because its cheaper than buying these notions in a haberdashery Nice fabric is particularly pricey All these people who spout crap about selfsufficiency have obviously never tried it Its a popular middleclass hobby because outlay costs are too expensive for poor families Yes once you have the set up and the skills a little bit of begging borrowing and ingenuity might keep you going without much cash but you need that initial investment I like the idea of skillingup the longterm unemployed and disabled people looking for an occupation to have the skills for selfsufficiency However as it was during the war this involves bringing these subjects into school starting nationwide schemes and providing grants In fairness after brexit it might be cheaper to get poor people growing veggies than importing veggies with huge tariffs so not entirely a bad idea If we are cutting ourself off from the world we might need to revert back to the policies we had last time this happened in WWII,310,10,0.03225806451612903

The point is partly not to stigmatise children who are identified by qualifying for free school dinners And like universal mailshots which needlessly target existing supporters its often cheaper to roll it out for everyone Are you going to underuse a school kitchen and staff because only a few children qualify for a meal A universal entitlement would also catch the child whose parents are perhaps too proud to have their child identified as poor,75,2,0.02666666666666667

And potentially largely unused  in Scotland free meals are available universally p13 and we get home a menu that rotates week to week Most of the meals are ok  nothing Ive ever had major issues with and fairly healthy with the odd treat meal like Pizza and chips thrown in every now and then  but my kids still prefer to have a packed lunch most of the time to the school dinners mainly because they are really hungry kids and get far more in a packed lunch than they do in a school meal  and before anyone rude comments none of my boys are overweight they have always been bang on weight for height they are just growing boys and do a lot of sport so need a lot to eat It would be a shame for this to be rolled out for all primary ages and then largely be unused by parents  would that money then just be surplus Seems a shame when there is a lot more in education that could use the cash  such as support for kids with special needs in schools or even just for basic equipment to use in lessons and those that really need the meals are in receipt of them anyway Maybe making it more thorougly means tested might be the answer  when I was younger you could only get FSM if you were on income support or equivalent but there are plenty of working families on low incomes that could use the help  deciding eligibility through receipt of a particular benefit is the problem I think My oldest confessed to me that he had been sharing his packed lunch with a boy in his class since he started P4 as his parents cannot afford the school meal  75 a day and also cannot afford to give him much more than a sandwich in his packed lunch I know his mum is a single parent who works but just struggles to make ends meet I always pack him extra now to make sure they both have enough to not be hungry because we can I do but there are so many families out there struggling xx,364,7,0.019230769230769232

John Fielder Universal benefits are indeed cheaper to administer but even in the pilot areas which were chosen because of higher than average rates of poverty a substantial part of the cost of the programme was the deadweight loss of feeding children whose parents previously paid for their own meals In richer areas that effect is going to be more pronounced The full report on the 2012 study is available at httpswwwgovukgovernmentuploadssystemuploadsattachmentdatafile184047DFERR227pdf From P150151 The universal pilot approach cost 1 million in Newham and 6 million in Durham equivalent to around per primary school pupil per year Of this 32 per cent in Newham and 46 per cent in Durham was deadweight cost that is involved paying for meals that would otherwise have been paid for by parents Other initiatives targeting similar outcomes such as the Jamie Oliver Feed Me Better campaign appeared to be able to deliver significant impacts at substantially lower cost,154,6,0.03896103896103896
Pekkathis is not a new policy Kids get free meals until year 2 Then those kids that need them get them anyway so yes kids clearly and obviously learn better with food in their stomachs that is the blindingly obvious Some may be falling through the net so extend the system if necessary but to give all kids free school meals is a waste of already precious few resources Also some dinner ladies have commented that there is no knowing who the free school meal kids are because of how the system is operated these days so that seems like a poor excuse It doest make senseits a ploy for some kind of popular vote which of course Labour needs but it could backfire,124,2,0.016129032258064516

No not all kids who need them get them its ludicrous to assume that some one earning 17k a year can afford to pay when someone earning 165k cant Two children eating school meals will cost a parent a minimum of a week so a year The cross over point for being eligible assumes that an extra pound in your wage makes life affordable And this is the same for most benefits so you are struggling and you work to make life better for yourself and your children then at the point where you are actually feeling like its making a difference all support is whipped away Universal support like this will make working a viable alternative to those people stuck in the benefits loop A working Britain would benefit everyone and help raise children who have been able to focus and learn at school and see that their parents have worked and achieved making them more likely to follow in their footsteps and not become trapped in the cycle themselves,171,2,0.011695906432748537

I have just done a calculation For a oneform entry primary school parents are paying 5 per pupil  3 a day for meals for this school year This will equate to a year of income from the juniors 120 pupils if we assume national average of 145 on FSM This can allow school to employ a teacher or 2 teaching assistants Wouldnt it be more effective if the money is used for employing staff to teach rather than giving every child free lunches,83,3,0.03614457831325301
