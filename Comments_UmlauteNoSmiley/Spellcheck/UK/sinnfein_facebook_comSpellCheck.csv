I disagree totallywith your pointThis is not the making of sinn feinthis is the politics of the DUPwho wont follow the princables of the goodfriday agreement  the st andrews agreementAnd have taken tax payers money to the tune of that itself is as bad of corruptio cronyisism you cant govern at state like that,54,12,0.2222222222222222
Really You wait  see what direct rule does have you any idea of the implications of it If you want to vent your frustration contact the Dup Sinn Fein made their position clear from the outset ALL parties have cited the Dups strong opposition on ALL issues as the blockade passive aggressive techniques at their finest How could anyone be expected to enter into a democratic power sharing government with an individual  her party at the centre of a 500million corruption scandal Itd be like going out for dinner with the burglars who ransacked your house to complete a loss valuation,101,6,0.0594059405940594
Sinn Fein are the only party showing conviction and doing exactly what they said theyd do No return to the status quo and no executive with Arlene Foster until an inquiry takes place Sinn Fein are delivering what the electorate voted for as they were aware of SFs conditions for a power sharing agreement with the DUP No pleasing some people,61,8,0.13114754098360656
Padraig Walsh exactly they made their position abundantly clear  their mandate was also clearly outlined with positive implementations for the people for the north What positive plans had foster  the Dup There was nothing she has thought since the last election if she adopts a I shall not be moved approach that the electorate will bow down to them they havent  rightly so All she had to do was stand aside but too arrogant too self righteous  too deceitful to do so Its an absolute disgrace,86,2,0.023255813953488372
This is not Sinn F doing The position was very clear from preelection Ministers that maymay not be involved in a scandal such as RHI should have stepped aside until an enquiry cleared them Not to mention terms of the Good Friday agreement being ignored and not implemented There simply can be no return to things as they were The electorate spoke in their numbers and they will again because for sure the Unionists will so why surrender to this by not voting,83,4,0.04819277108433735

Maurice I dont understand how you can say thatWe have been paying for water through general tax through the motor tax which included water taxThey were setting up Irish Water to be sold offNo the future generations will thank us,40,4,0.1
I believe that setting up Irish Water was correct and charging for water was correct because there is a huge infrastructure deficitbut that it should never be sold off and a referendum is correct,34,1,0.029411764705882353
Why was there an infrastructure deficit when the people were paying water charges,13,0,0.0
It was because the people were not paying water charges directly except the rural group water schemes ,17,0,0.0
Maurice all the people were paying water tax Maybe not directly to a company who pay large saleries to people who then pay large amounts to consultants Who then give large bonuses to those people at the topWho have private gyms etc for their staffThats fine if the company is making profits and the company is running efficiently and there is no waste of waterIt would also be ok if the people were not being taxed to the hilt in this country for everything elseIf you cannot see what is wrong here then it must be a political point with you,101,7,0.06930693069306931
Maurice They were still paying itIf there was no expenditure on the system then the people should be refunded that money,21,1,0.047619047619047616
The problem was that not enough money was not set aside from general taxation for the water infrastructure and the reasoning is that if the money is paid directly from the water users that Irish Water will have enough money to do all the work that needs to be done  its water treatment plants and sewerage treatments that need to be built and a lot of them upgraded As a stand alone company Irish Water will be able to raise money on the money markets  there is a huge amount of work to be done,95,0,0.0

We just got the chance to visit your beautiful country a week ago  Are you being taxed for water It rains 80 inches a yearAm I understanding this correctly,29,1,0.034482758620689655
Water has to be treated and infrastructure maintained but we have been paying through general taxation for yearsnow they want us to pay twice to cover a huge blunder setting up an unneeded Irish water company that cost millions of euro If a fraction of that money had been invested in the County Councils that were looking after the water systemwe would have a top qualityleak free system,68,4,0.058823529411764705
Hope you had an enjoyable visit Debra and the weather was kind to you it can be very unpredictable and as you say we tend to have more than our fair share of rain We have actually been paying for our water service for the past 20 years through taxation In fact through double taxation as we now also pay a for it through our motor tax  66 in fact goes to water This we accepted in the assumption that it would go toward improving our water infrastructure and quality which is very poor in on many areas and undrinkable however it seems this was not the case There have been no improvements in the service or quality despite over 17 billion approx having been collected through these taxes Three years ago the government hastily put together a company called Irish Water plc bought millions of second hand home water meters and began installing them at our homes with the announcement that we would soon be receiving bills charges for our water usage and wastage from this new company notwithstanding the fact that we arealready paying twice through taxation An EU directive they told us that Must be obeyed It was the straw that broke the camels back as our public services are systematically being allowed to fall into complete and utter decay and despair We are currently operating in a third world scenario regarding health services hospital care homelessness evictions food poverty we now have food banks and soup kitchens operating throughout the country and entire families living in hotel rooms or on the streets the list is endless Meanwhile our government are busy privatising and selling off our natural resources and utilities to corporations and overseas investors while selling our debts and property off to vulture funds all the while proclaiming to the EU and anyone who will listen that we experiencing an amazing economic recoveryAll liesonly on paper and imaginary figures with nothing tangible behind them Even though they have been caught fudging the figures nothing changes That said the 1 of our billionaires are tripling their wealth And sowe finally had enough Hence the water protests which have become about so much more than that Weve found our voices again we are waking up in our masses Apologies for the lengthy replyit takes a bit of explaining but there you have it ,396,7,0.017676767676767676

I trust they will commemorate the irishmen who were killed on both sides of the rising too often Ireland ignores the young irishmen who died wearing a british uniform and who had been sent to stop the rebellion I trust too they will remember the thousands of young nationalists who died in world war one fighting for what their leaders had said would eventually gain Irish Independence ,67,3,0.04477611940298507
NO the wearing of the Easter Lily is to commemorate those who fought for Irelands FREEDOM Those who fought to stop the rebellion fought for the exact opposite they fought to continue Irelands being under the rule of Britain Either you are crazy or you just spoke some of the stupidest words Ive ever heard What the hell are you even talking about Are you even in your right mind or are you tripping on something,76,3,0.039473684210526314
Those Irishmen catholics and protestants who were sent to stop the rebellion were in fact just soldiers my point was that many patriotic irishmen of nationalist backround joined the british army in 1914 responding the irish nationalist leader Redmond who called for them to join up and fight as it would lead to home rule and ultimately the opportunity for freedom Now the easter uprising was a small band of rebels who believed in a republic but they were a minority in the population Republicanism was not supported I suppose you forget that those rebels killed Irish nationalists serving in the British Army many just think they killed brits The easter rebellion was a failure The British government martyred the leaders and that is where the rise of SF becomes significant for the years following But Irish nationalists and Republicans have forgotten those Irish nationalist who were answering Irelands political leaders and who believed they were fighting for Irish freedom and died in flanders and the western Front and in turkey they even made those men returning at the end of the war lepars in their own homes Only in the last 5 years has a free Ireland had the dignity to remember their dead,205,11,0.05365853658536585

Many may ask the question How can there be a united Ireland if nationalists continue to honor those who fought for Irelands freedom from Britain while others honor those who fought to keep her in subjugation to Britain Take my own country the US for example In the American Civil war the north union fought the south confederacy over the socalled issue of states sovereignty However today you will not find any northerners that cannot be friends with southerners Weve all mostly put it behind us The joining of hands of those who wish for unity combined with time and distance will soon outweigh and overcome the minority of those who yet savor enmity and call for strife one day patriotism will become more inclusive as new issues face the united people of Ireland,134,6,0.04477611940298507

Where did you hear that,5,0,0.0
On a page called call for a revolution in Ireland  they are saying that all the parties are going to agree on the charge forwater after a certain usage they have gone very quiet on the abolition of the company known asIrish water in fact Mary lou has said I heard her myself say that the country does need a single utility Irish water must be abolished if its not the privatisation of our water can be achieved by stealth Stephen Mcmahon I would like to know their final position on the issue and will they have a referendum on the ownership of the nations water,106,4,0.03773584905660377
First of all I would like to know when did you hear mary Lou say thatsecond of we are all grown ups we knownwater has to be paid for But it was always the case from subsidizing it from other taxations that Sinn Fein policy on water chargers there is nothing water meter being put outside any persons home and no utility bills will be sent out to any persons home Sinn Fein will stand by this,77,7,0.09090909090909091
She has said it a few times thank you for the answer I know where they stand I wish they would just come out and say that they are not in favour of the abolition of Irish water and that we should all grow up and pay for water I cant believe sinn fein are no different to the rest of the parties in the Dail as long as Irish water exists privatisation is on the agenda and sinn fein know this its time to get the truth out there about this again thank you for your reply,98,5,0.05102040816326531

I think your proposal of a national health scheme is a clever bargaining chip in swaying support for a unified Ireland In the north irrespective of your leaning it is generally the first issue of concern raised at the prospect of joining with the republic The issue that concerns me most  l have raised previously is educating many in the Republic that what those in the north have endured is as noble and identical to the struggles prior to partition There appears in some sections of that community to be a lack of understanding and empathy for what they have enduredAs far as the Unionists the tri colour was devised as a symbol of togetherness all the way back in the 1840s and should be used as the major symbol of saying We Are One Come With UsGoodluck and condolences to Mr McGuinness loved ones,145,5,0.034482758620689655

Like most on the left I have never been a huge fan of the EU here in England and I dont like the way it is now being used as another stick to beat Labour leader Jeremy  but Brexit has an unsavoury right wing side to it here  like the Britain First nutter who murdered that unfortunate MP and I fear his attitude though not his terrible action may be fairly widespread  and like the right wing Tories opposed to workers rights within the EUOn another level the brit working class got fed up with the perceived gravy train of the EU benefiting a minority around London while there was little worthwhile investment in thei provincial communitieswith closure of industries etcand there is something in that But I can see why SF favours EU membership it does provide an alternative to british rule influence and the cursed border It doesnt have to be slavelike as Jeremy of Labour says the thing is ensure that workers rights are protected whether outside or within the EU context And maybe we dont have much alternative as far as that goes,187,13,0.06951871657754011

Americans Australians and other citizens outside the EU cannot live or work in the EU without a work or residential visa and these are limited and subject to type of work and conditions EU citizens have full access to all jobs and residence in Europe without limitations no need for expensive visa and subject to conditions Also citizens outside of the EU do not have free or reduced cost access to the vast education system or health system across Europe I would say there is a big difference between being in and being out of the EU for Britains as its right on our door stepWe couldnt travel freely across Europe before we were in the EU you could only stay in Greece for 6 months and you needed a visa to work The only work you could get was seasonal as Greece wasnt part of the EU in the early 80s Yes you may gain limited work but it will not be of a high standard of work The opportunities will only be accessible after Brexit for the Elitists You cannot just turn up in America or Australia and have free movement there is no special agreement and their healthcare costs are astronomical You find t have access to the E111 either before we joined the EU We are not part of the Schengen agreement and have always controlled our boarders so I never understood that argument Taking back control of our boarders in the Brexit campaigns The difference is before we joined the EU we could travel but only the wealthy who could afford to there was an increase in travelling abroad after we joined the EU as people could then afford to as their disposable incomes increased due to the reduction in food costs which came about by joining the EU in the first place Go figure and ask in whose best interest are we leaving the EU,321,9,0.028037383177570093
To be fair as a UK citizen working in Europe I have most to lose but I just cant see this happening Expensive work Visas What 20 quid every 2 years if the country requires your skills they will allow you to come in and work the uk needs people from farm workers to doctors nurses and engineersI do question why we cant train our own people to cover those jobs mind but if there not needed then no you dont come in for work simpleI do however draw a line at allowing access to free healthcare schooling houses ectWhy do they not stay in their own countries for thisIts because they cant fund it and nor can the UK to that matter and a reason for my choice of brexit The uk infrastructure is bursting and the EU wouldnt make simple changes to give workable solutions to these problems Im not sure how much prices will in fact go up If Europe dont want to make a deal with us it will hit them more than the UK Worst case is we go WTO trade deal and add 5Surely this will be off set by lower coporation tax already stated by theresa may so allowing companies to offset and lower their prices to combat this we also have the fact we can make better deals with the rest of the worldIts give and take some items may increase slightly others will go down Not to mention the vast sum of money we inject into the EU Ok I agree it remains to be seen what will be done with this and who knows with a tory governmentall I am trying to say is I dont think this is as bad as everyone makes it out to soundtheirs workable solutions that will suit both sides and I am willing to make sacrifices short term to safeguard my childrens future weather it be education work availability of housing ect I dont know if this will work but my present feeling is it wont be worse,344,24,0.06976744186046512

Colm Our Lady warned of this in 1917 She said that there would be an evil Council and a new Mass And that Communism would be spread all over the world It happened as She said She said in La Salette in 1846 that  Rome would lose the faith and become the seat of antichrist the Church will be in eclipse These are Church approved apparitionsLook at these changes they made to the Mass after the Second Vatican Council httpswwwfacebookcommedjugorjefraudvideos774600579304678,80,5,0.0625

I totally agree with not going back to the Status Quo If we surrender on this the ball with be back in the Unionist court and we wont ever get it back to continue the ball game Too much has been lost and fought for over the past decades In honouring all of the fallen dead on all sides of the conflict it is imperative there is no return to Direct Rule The Irish Government led by FF FG and the rest will do as they have always done and sit on the fence We have come this far in the process with the Good Friday agreement we need to move on to the next stage The cash for ash has to be addresses first The Unionist need to see the bigger picture for all concerned Foster has to step down Temporally but like the Garda commissioner in the Republic their Ego and Pride would be hurt Stubbornness can be overcome through direct dialogue and common sense,167,3,0.017964071856287425

To justify some of these comments would be foolish History taught us that to achieve liberation from oppression we must first stand up to those who have taken our rights From Mandela to Martin you must realize the path is painful not easy We lost millions of our folk to famine and emigration They died at home and on the high seas So take stock of whats happened No angel died but a man who loved his people and Ireland,80,1,0.0125

I am writing from England You may have seen the Brexit plan from the UK Westminster Government It is flimsy contradictory and of no help to creating a truly United Kingdom for the future Best of luck if you are trying to get genuine dialogue from our Government In my view all they appear to be interested in is power politics not working in partnership with the UK Parliament with the EU or with anyone else I am one of many people in the UK dispirited by what is happening If it all goes horribly wrong as looks inevitable do you have space for me my wife and our dog who is appropriately named Ceilidh in Ireland please,118,1,0.00847457627118644

I really dont know what to make of this one to be honest He clearly tried to make amends and played a major part in bringing about the far more serene Northern Ireland we see today For that everyone should be grateful but sadly Im not sure that this casts the man in a totally positive light At the end of the day its a known fact that he was also complicit in some dreadful acts of violence and terrorism which sadly do stain his reputation somewhat,87,2,0.022988505747126436

Not Im my lifetime could I put together a political party to win a electionas Sinn Fein are in with a chance to win the next election and they are talking about freedommy question is it a real Irish freedom or just letting the eu decide on what we dosure thats just as bad as the Brits telling us what to do,62,8,0.12903225806451613
So I could win a referenda by myselfI dont think its that simpleunfortunately,13,3,0.23076923076923078
I understand what youre saying There are some parallels some of the issues are the samebut I think Brussels is much more palatable than Westminster,25,2,0.08
Liam Blake Ireland is the EU Its not us and them Martin McGuinness campaigned to Remain Critical participation is the way forward,22,2,0.09090909090909091
I agree with a lot of what Sinn Fein does and I always vote for themwhen it was the EEC it was good for Irelandbut not anymore they have more and more power over us and it growingnot only will they bring in a corporation tax that will make the multinationals head for the hillsthey have brought in the home taxwater taxsays how much our fishermen can fish and heaped all that debt on us and thats only the tip of the icebergthe eu is as corrupt as the politicians we have here nowbut at least we get to vote on them fuckers,103,13,0.1262135922330097
Liam Blake I agree that the corporation tax issue needs to be underlined for Ireland but so far there hasnt been an attempt to converge them Hungary even lowered their rate last year we had the common fisheries policy as part of the EEC too we have had property charges on and off like I think its really difficult to distinguish between EU policy and what the state conducts Corruption is always an issue with state institutions and politicians but I think we should focus on the citizens benefits like the right to appeal at the ECJ and freedom of movement With the issue of voting thats where the European Parliament and European Council come in I thought Sinn Fein were good on Jobsbridge its disappointing to see them go into opposition all the time,135,7,0.05185185185185185
Ciaran u have made some good pointsbut the freedom of movement has been a disasterall it has done is dropped the wage and working rights for people here and make it harder to get a jobu need a cv now to get a job in a shopa few years ago all u had to do was go in and askmost employers favour Eastern Europeans over Irish workers and Ill give u a example there is a massive meat company in Cavanthey mainly hire Eastern EuropeansIm friends with the owe era brother and asked him yhe saidthey dont talk back they will do any hours they are told to dowont go on strike or give any of the hassle the Irish willbut thats not the worse of itI went out of business in 2011 so went into sign ona guy had brought his friend in who had just come in from Romaniahe had only come in to collect the dole not to look for workand dont get me started on the debt WE got stuck with because of reckless lending by EU BANKS,182,23,0.12637362637362637
Liam Blake Could I get the name of the meat company please Its difficult to discuss EU matters with anecdotal evidence Every EU state sets its own minimum wage after that its competition for labour If it is correct that Eastern European workers are being exploited here in Ireland against EU workers rights my own animosity would be directed at the company not the worker trying to make a better life for themselves As well with regards accessing social welfare it seems really odd to me to just to brag to random people in the office what you are up to if its going to have a negative backlash And even then without work doesnt habitual residence have to be established  With regards EU banks which include Irish banks because it isnt us and them the reckless lending and subsequent guarantees were loans and pooled debt we failed to regulate our state failed to regulate lending too we are just as responsible although how we ended up with 40 of the debt is nuts,174,3,0.017241379310344827
Ciaran its Liffey meats in bjdbut as u are young Ill take that as how u dont realise as things used to workand if u dont think EU WORKERS ARE BEING EXPLOITEDcheck out sports direct in Nottinghamas for Ireland taking all the weight of EU BANKSif I lend to uu cannot pay me backthats down to me as I lent to uso whoever the Irish banks borrowed off is up to themthey should have stress tested them banks they lent to,81,16,0.19753086419753085

And tell me this ciaran I gave nearly 10 k stamp duty on my over inflated housey should I pay a property tax on a house I own and get nothing forin the uk they get there bins collected and a subsides on binswhat do I get no subsides on bins and in Cavan no water I pay for waterdo u still live with ur parents,66,8,0.12121212121212122
Liam Blake Nah live with my mates Doesnt your council run a bin collection service Mine does As I said we have had property taxes beforeif your council doesnt provide services for the tax you pay I understand that is frustratingI dont know how the county famous for its riverways doesnt provide water serviceseither And with the matter of exploited workers I return you to my above point about companies not the workers I can feel you are very angry but I think it is misdirected With regards lending me money that I am unable to pay you have the option to take me to court which may result in a bailiff seizing my assets As we already established with regards stress tests and credit ratings I return to my original point that we failed to regulate our own banks EU banks that is,144,10,0.06944444444444445
Lets get Sinn Fein into power in the 26 countiesthen the people will give them a mandate not only for a border poll but a referendum on whether to stay in the EUIts entirely up to the peopleFianna Fail nor Fine Gael dont give a damn about the ordinary folksthey only care about the banksters and stuffing their own pocketsif people really want changeI believe with all my heart they will vote Sinn Feinand bring Ireland into a new dawn of equalityand respect for all of usno more homelessness and austerityproper grassroots government for all not the FEW I am full of optimism for the future of lreland as a wholeout with the old croniesin with a freshyoung energetic Sinn Feinwith many wonderful young and extremely intelligent young women now at the forechange for the better is irresistibletime to move with the Zeitgeistthe future looks bright with Sinn FeinMartin McGuinness and his colleagues did all the hard ground worklets not waste his wonderful legacythe future is with SINN FEIN,169,32,0.1893491124260355

Ciaran u dont get ur bins collected as part of the property taxI have been on the website and u do not get any services for itmaybe ur thinking of the ukalso we never had a property tax in Ireland b4 it was household rates as far as I knowwhich was then heaped on to business premisesso now that the property tax is in and they havent reduced business rates they are milking bothand dont be fooled the eu are bringing in corporation tax harmony across the eu and Ireland will be powerless to stop it,96,17,0.17708333333333334
Why notif the majority vote for itthen there is no reason except those who dont want peaceand are only interested in themselves and a skewed sense of loyalty to a country that has already agreed that if the majority want a united Irelandthey have no say in the matteras long as its peaceful and democratica lot of unionists would rather have a peaceful united lreland and be treated equally and with respectthan go back to the dark black days of the troublesespecially the young people across the political spectrumI personally think its a great opportunityand should be given at least a chanceinstead of being squanderedits up to all of us to try and make it workwhat you dont tryyou dont get,121,18,0.1487603305785124

Hmmm Considering that there was ALOT more republicans killed by loyalists and British security forces  all of whom have family members this makes your post so irrelavant These people fought for none other than to keep their country together For their families and for the love of it but instead it had been taken away from them because of a power status greed and money These people had so much pride in their country they made decisions which put their own lives on the line and sometimes unfortunatly others but it was all for one thingThe Freedom of Irelandcan call this place whatever you want but one thing you can never take away is the love and irish spirit  it will live on forever Rip Martin McGuinness,127,8,0.06299212598425197

The English government have 2 be fair Stephen gone into countries all over the world Raped them of their commodities and then left Leaving carnage Im pretty sure England dont want the north anymore They took what they needed and they dont care Im surprised that some people of any persuasion think that it was OK to treat people with a different religion in the manner which Catholics were treated in the past was ok I would ask you if it was reversed would it be ok to have job discrimination not having a vote because you didnt have a home If this was played out in another country I sincerely hope you would have an objective view Not all Catholics hate protestant people we didnt like being suppressed And I think thats acceptable The republican movement was born because of mistreatment of people How ever you are entitled to your opinion but from looking at yesterday I think you may find yourself in the minority in the future Lets hope Irish people dont treat ye the same as what was done to us Thank you,186,11,0.05913978494623656

Britains main export throughout the world was terrorism In the north we had the British army and the RUC and the UFF and the UVF and the UDA and the UDR all unionist loyalist terrorist groups Their main purpose was to terrorize and murder Catholics Do you sympathize with their victimsSince Britain is considered by millions to be a terroristic government should we not have sympathy for those victims of Westminsteror should we simply say well they are in England they had it coming to themMartin mcguinness was a man who stood in front of an evil empire and told them No No you will no longer abuse my people Good on ya Martin,114,12,0.10526315789473684

Demonising your Country Jack Thompson A Tyrannical Empire that still to this day causes untold suffering and the murder of Innocent people Now that is terrorism I see a sense of superiority and ignorance seems to be in high supply When you bomb and dehumanise foreign lands people tend to fight back Just saying Whats with the old white man comment What relevance does skin colour have Martin Mc Guinness was a freedom fighter and responsible for creating a platform for basic human rights and a peacemaker Take your cluelessness elsewhere please Ireland is mourning one of her bravest sons Very fitting tribute RIP Martin ,105,4,0.0380952380952381

Isaiah 59Sin Separates Us from God1 Behold the LORDS hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear2 But your iniquities have separated between you and your God and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear3 For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue hath muttered perverseness4 None calleth for justice nor anypleadeth for truth they trust in vanity and speak lies they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity5 They hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spiders web he that eateth of their eggs dieth and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper6 Their webs shall not become garments neither shall they cover themselves with their works their works are works of iniquity and the act of violence is in their hands7 Their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and destruction are in their paths8 The way of peace they know not andthere is no judgment in their goings they have made them crooked paths whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace9 Therefore is judgment far from us neither doth justice overtake us we wait for light but behold obscurity for brightness but we walk in darkness10 We grope for the wall like the blind and we grope as if we had no eyes we stumble at noonday as in the night we are in desolate places as dead men11 We roar all like bears and mourn sore like doves we look for judgment butthere is none for salvation but it is far off from us12 For our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sins testify against us for our transgressions are with us and as for our iniquities we know them13 In transgressing and lying against the LORD and departing away from our God speaking oppression and revolt conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood14 And judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afar off for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter15 Yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey and the LORD saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgmentSalvation is Only of God16 And he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him17 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloke18 According to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompence to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompence19 So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun When the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against himThe Covenant of the Redeemer20 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob saith the LORD21 As for me this is my covenant with them saith the LORD My spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed saith the LORD from henceforth and for ever,601,45,0.07487520798668885

Lol Have you read all the comments on this post Ive never seen as much evidence of brainwashing in my life Historicity is lacking in the Republican movement Hitler was right when he saidIf you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough it will be believedMake the lie big make it simple keep saying it and eventually they will believe itAll propaganda has to be popular and has to accommodate itself to the comprehension of the least intelligent of those whom it seeks to reachThe broad masses of a population are more amenable to the appeal of rhetoric than to any other forceIt would seem the Republican movement have used his handbook on propaganda But hey everyone loves their cowardly freedom fighters,125,7,0.056

Heres a starter for 10 All this happened long before there was the BritishHistory is actually more interesting than hegalian propaganda I suggest you study it and never use political parties as your sourceThe Norman invasion of Ireland took place in stages during the late 12th century at a time when Gaelic Ireland was made up of several kingdoms with a High King claiming lordship over allIn May 1169 CambroNorman mercenaries landed in Ireland at the request of Diarmait Mac Murchada Dermot MacMurragh the ousted King of Leinster who had sought their help in regaining his kingdom This military intervention had the backing of King Henry II of England Pope Adrian IV had authorized Henry to conquer Ireland as a means of bringing the Irish church into line Diarmait and the Normans seized Leinster within weeks and launched raids into neighbouring kingdoms,142,15,0.1056338028169014
Judge and you will be judged Let him without sin cast the first stone Thou shalt not steal thou shalt not lie bear false witness against the neighbour Britain give to God all you stole,35,2,0.05714285714285714
You missed go and sin no more One of the reasons the Pope ordered the invasion of Ireland was that he was pissed at these pagan tribes and cheiftans comming over and raiding his faithful in England His church dont like you stealing from her,45,3,0.06666666666666667

Up to the end of the 60s republicans in Northern Ireland were second class citizens Loyalists and the British were born into privilege and made sure that privilege was maintained for their offspring For example the Loyalist farmer always got top price for his milk it was always rated as high cream content In contrast the republican farmer always got the lowest price for his milk always rated the lowest possible the actual quality of the milk had no bearing on the priceWhen Catholics or Republicans were employed in hospitals as nurses After they qualified they were fired That way no republicans were able to get into a managerial position which was reserved for the Loyalists Manny professional republicans eventually emigrated I know many of them in Australia Same story with Harland and Wolff shipbuilding yards it was all controlled by Loyalists All this discrimination led to the Loyalists being much more wealthy than the Republicans and they controlled the economyPolice and all the civil service were tightly controlled by the loyalists it was an undeclared apartheid systemTo be registered on the electoral roll you could only do so if you were a property owner and of course with the imbalance of wealth there was also a great imbalance in the ratio to Republican voters compared to the general populationWhat the Unionists could not contrive with electoral role they used gerrymandering to add the final touchesUsually Stormont was composed of 11 unionists and one republican and in a community that was about 60 Unionists to about 40 RepublicanThe British army could not defeat the IRA which militarily was irrelevant compared to the might of the British Army That is because the IRA was necessary for the people the IRA lived in the songs in the pubs in the hearts of good decent people such as grandmothers and grandfathers that had for years seen them discriminated against and nobody seemed to careNow the IRA was fighting back and admired by the normal Catholics and republicans whose only wish was to be treated fairly in their own Country The republicans and Catholics were second class citizens in their own country and presided over by a people that did not identify with Ireland they did not want to be called Irish but called themselves BritishYes they were the ones the IRA stood up to and the rank and file republicans thought finally someone is on our sideWhilst I regret the fact that the Republicans had to fight and kill people to effect change I make no apologies for the mistakes when you are fighting a civil war and treated like a criminal by the ruling elite its very difficult to operate The real mistake was made by the British they should have stayed homeMartin McGuinness was born into the epicentre of this discrimination and was admired and revered by the victims of this discriminationIts okay for those born and raised into the privilege of a one person one vote system to condemn Martin McGuinness andor the IRA for their actions at the time I say the followingYou dont know how you would have behaved in the same circumstancesI think I would have been killed long agoWhat we do know is that Republicans in Northern Ireland have a much better life these days largely due to the struggles of Martin McGuinness and others like him in the IRA,564,23,0.040780141843971635

When I hear the negative people pointing towards violence and the many people who died and were injured and omitting the peace the powersharing the reconciliation the care and the attention given to the finer details I feel sorry that those negative people are missing out on a truly wonderful story a truly amazing story The politicians of today even those who are acknowledging the great work done by Martin but covering their own arses by clouding the truth with concentration on the violence of the past  will never tell the full story can never tell the full story as that full story would highlight how little they and their predecessors had actually done for peaceI do seriously hope that somehow the story of this mans life can be told and will be told in the not too distant future because everybody including the future generations need to know that a true man of the people achieved greatness beyond what the greater majority of people could hardly even comprehend and that that man of greatnesswas one of ourown a boy from DerryI have tears in my eyes as I write this I feel this loss so much,197,7,0.03553299492385787

Those that condemn Martin McGuinness IRA days should reflect that when there is no access to law in order to resolve gievancies and the invasion of ones own land there is only one course of action left When the People shall grow weary of Government they may exercise their democratic right to amend it or their revolutionary right to overthrow it The advice and the words of PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN There was no other option,75,2,0.02666666666666667
Its odd Sir that you mention Abraham Lincoln in this context I have long been a supporter of the Likes of Martin McGuiness and his compatriots Lincoln was a war criminal and a liar Rotting in hell is far too easy of an eternal fate for Lincoln after what he did here in the South My condolences to all of you for your loss,64,1,0.015625

Enda Ian Paisely was one of the architects of the downfall of primeminister ONeill who had liberal ideas for the future of Northern Ireland  He marched with the UVF  he caused the downfall of the powersharing agreement in the 1970s and all because he refused Catholics a say in Northern Ireland  If any of these situations had been left to fruition there would never have been half the murder that occurred and whats worse about Paisley is that he pretended to be a man of God Blood was all over his hands,92,8,0.08695652173913043
Emmett Donovan paisley had no blood on his hands he never went out to murder a lot of rubbish he never refused Catholics a saythis is about mcguinnees an unrepented ira man that went to his grave with truths that families of their loved ones murdered while he was a commander will never be answered his priest couldnt save him,60,5,0.08333333333333333

Ena Davison John Careylook please at the truth Britain is a crumbling empire with only wealth it stole from other countries to comfort them Now they are brexiting away desperately hanging on in other peoples countries where they are not wanted are they not embarrassed now in front of the eyes of the world Welcome you guys to our country in peace keep your criminality and excuses for war We are a peace loving country and in our whole history we had real rebels with a real cause we had no choice only to defend against the attrocities of your evil empire that stood only for robbery theft violence colonization slavery starvation nepotism shame tyranny brutality Partition make no mistake still we fight with our weapon of peace And still you cant recognise and appologise for this history you gave not just to Ireland but to the world If you cant face the truth at least try and examine your history Welcome to our Island as a whole an inclusive island where you are wanted and recognise defence first before you utter the word terrorism We welcome all people here some are here 300 years we have all nationalities here Martin was Super in his defence of humanity and God bless him He was so loved by us all in Ireland and International,223,5,0.02242152466367713

Ena he caused the demise of the powersharing agreement in the 1970s which is similar to todays agreements Catholics had very little political power and little representation things would have been very different and a lotless people murdered and in the demonstrations in the 70s he marched proudly side by side with the UVF  Not to mention the speeches of hate which legitimized actions of other people,67,7,0.1044776119402985

Richard Holland the white lily is bad luck maybe republican ira should change their flowerOrange maybe  The ira were no freedom fighters but terrorists who thought it their right to bomb and murder innocent people because they were oppressed and wanted freedom but never carried on their campian of terror they were beat so took to peace they had no choice and were given letters so they could not be brought to court for their atrocities almost all the ira were agents anyway,83,5,0.060240963855421686

Ena Davison our Island allows for an inclusive society When brexit comes it will not make slightest difference to nationalists who remain united in our own country You seem to think that north of Ireland is a seperate country we have 9 counties If you cant look at the map correctly and the geography God made with his own hands you need to get your head examined What is your problem britsish colonizers are in other islands too around world like poor people in falklands dont want them but still they are invading with same terror as in north of our country How do you sleep at night You cant tell the truth the british are here not wanted they have their own country so what are they still doing here we dont want themBut we need them to recognise our country as a whole Through peace processwe hope people like you see sense live like neighbours stop with your lies face truth Martin brought us all here down this road to take our Island back peacefully Our people north south east west have fought for hundreds of years against terrorism Martin being one of the bravest,197,10,0.050761421319796954
CarolineLucinda first the British people of the falklands stood strong in the face of aggression who wanted to take the Falklands Like the ira tried to take northern Ireland into a united Ireland but failedsecond I sleep well at night its about people like you who need to see senseand live with your protestant neighbours like it used to be the peace came from all parties not just terrorists of the ira they entered peace talks because their cause was lost and its not your island it belongs to all 3 Martin mcguinnees was no brave man while in command he ordered the worst atrocities of the troubles 4 my ancestors came up the liffey in a long boat and Im not going anywhere,124,9,0.07258064516129033
Ena Davisonthe truth is the slave trade was part of british regime in falklands and falklands belong to Argentina IRA didnt try take N IRE into a united Ire NIre was and still is in a United Ire We dont divide people here or a country and then blame religionThe british regime need to recognise thisOur island has many peaceful supporters for our nationalists held in captivity and living in a war waged against them under british empire We with many other countries are in solidarity with one another against slavery terrorism colonisation and war This is anisland for everyone Bigotry is against truth fear keeps peopledivided IRA never failed and when the peace talks began I do recall the british gov saying that strategically they were not interested in staying in Ireland long term We look forward to an Independent Ireland one day with everyone on board and this takes time IRA without doubt for hundreds of years fought british Its becaise of brave men like Martin we have peace God bless him Failure belongs to people who want to remain living in a divided atmosphere And Ena yes this is my country it belongs to everyone living here but in an island as a whole,207,19,0.09178743961352658
Caroline Lucinda did youhave your weetabix today ira bombed and murdered their way to the peace table are you for real your comment we dont divide peoplerelegion did come into it what  Martin mcguinnees was an unrepentant ira terrorist even on his death bed he could have give comfort to the families of their loved ones from both sides that were murdered while he was in commandwhy bring the falkandsup  also the rebellion of 1916 only fought for the south they were not interested in the northso blame them God bless northern Irelanda country for all,96,12,0.125

I have a little reminder here especially relevant to the Brits and UnionismLoyalism in particular UN Resolution 30131973The Legal Status of Combatants Struggling Against Alien Domination and Racist Regimes was agreed to in 1973 It reaffirms that The continuation of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations as noted in General Assembly resolution 2621 XXV of 12 October 1970 is a crime and that colonial peoples have the inherent right to struggle by ALL MEANS NECESSARY at their disposal against colonial Powers and alien domination in exercise of their right of selfdetermination,92,4,0.043478260869565216

Have lived in NI for 19 years I too am English I want to reiterate those comments made by Steve Moseley I have no doubt that Martin McGuinness brought terror to the streets of NI for nigh on 20 years There are those that cannot forgive and I both understand and respecttheir views But also let us be in no doubt that NI would not be where it is today without the immense contribution for peace of Martin McGuinness He was a very charismatic man and a politician who as already said made a significant contribution to where NI now stands both at home and abroad His work for peace must continue in his memoryand in memory of all those who suffered and lost loved ones in the Troubles,129,4,0.031007751937984496
Thank you Steve for those kind words Martin McGuinness wasnt perfect nor did he ever profess to be so but he took an enormous step to bring about peace as did John Hume another great politician from Derry they bothtried to unite the people of this country as did Ian Paisley Snr all those who sit in Criticism need to take a step back and ask themselves what have they done to further peace,74,4,0.05405405405405406
Darren Yelkcarb We must also remember the terror that the Unionists and British Army inflicted on the Catholic community that led to conflict But yes Martin McGuinness made significant progress in his contribution to the peace process The history books should be kind to him in years to come when they look back and evaluate all the effort he made,60,2,0.03333333333333333

Martin McGuinness will be sorely missed When I hear the comments of the Brittish media and ignorant politicians talking of the damage done by the IRA in Britain which I do not condone while Brittish troops roamed the streets of my Country and Killed inocent people Bloody Sunday was a march for 1 MAN 1 VOTE We could continue this argument forever or do what Martin did and search for peace I have not heard 1Irish Politician condem any Brittish paratrooper for that Im greatfulWell done MaryLou a fitting tribute,90,10,0.1111111111111111

Moving words and delivered with great respect some republicans turned their backs on Martin and Gerry for bringing peace Ive never doubted him and know that everything he did was for the people of this island and those bitter people who have posted bile about martins passing should be great full that they have been born into a peaceful country that had rivers of blood flowing down our streets for far too long god bless you and thanks for being strong enough to deliver peace against all odds,88,1,0.011363636363636364
