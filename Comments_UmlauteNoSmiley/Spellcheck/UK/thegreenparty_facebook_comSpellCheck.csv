That is a really shit article from the independent to read just be pro active about it not try and get one up with this it does neither party any good I see Molly Scott mentions a maximum wage did JC not raise this 3 months ago and get the usual abuse I love the green party but lately all i see is you posting silly things like this being a little bitchy for a better word Get behind it,80,2,0.025

Apart from one crucial thing which has made me rethink my labour party membership Labour issued a 3 line whip to support the Tories in the brexit vote That for me was a deal breaker Labour should have joined the Greens and the SNP in opposing the bill and if they had maybe a few more disgruntled Tories would have joined them and possibly defeated the bill,67,2,0.029850746268656716
Do you not respect democracy then I voted to remain in the EU I lost the vote However as a grown up who can handle not always getting my own way I respected the outcome of the vote Do you flip tables when you lose at monopoly just out of interest Corbyn could have stripped naked and smeared himself in jam whilst screaming to remain in the EU but it would not alter the result of a democratic vote Be angry at the British public for how they voted not Corbyn for respecting democracy I did suggest to one person that we should depose Corbyn and get King Canute in to work his magic on leaving the EU but they thought it was a rubbish idea as well,128,4,0.03125

If you support a change to minimum wage policy as the Greens suggest then how about getting behind the fact other parties are also adopting the policy instead of bitching about who thought of it first  If its a good idea which it is then the Greens should be ecstatic that changes they want to see are being picked up by more parties Instead they choose to moan about the fact they thought of it first  As Lee said childish,80,0,0.0
Disagree I dont feel that what is happening is political point scoring as such more highlighting that there is more to be done There is nothing wrong with noting with humour what the party policies are especially if it gives us extra exposure We want to make a difference and smaller parties like ours and UKIP have always influenced the larger parties something Jenny Jones highlighted with sass in the 2015 campaign,72,3,0.041666666666666664

Instead of celebrating the fact that what you consider to be good policy is being picked up by other parties you are saying but we thought of it first Thats bitchy Im afraid There doesnt have to be a fullfledged alliance to be happy that other parties are changing their policies to be more in line with your views If you truly believe minimum wage policy change is a good thing other parties adopting this approach too should be cause for celebration not cries of we thought of it first,90,4,0.044444444444444446
Luke Butterfield So we failed your test an dont truly believe minimum wage policy is a good thing It is entirely legitimate for us to point out that we not only thought of it first but also long ago because that is an indication how far behind other parties are in their thinking In blind tests we get majority support for our policies which to my mind is a sign that we have won the argument if not the power to put our thoughts into action Of course we welcome it when other parties adopt our policies particularly when they give credit where credit is due,106,1,0.009433962264150943

Exactly Elise Because Im Scottish I have never really defined myself in terms of class which has never been a barrier to social advancement or access to higher education or the professions in Scotland My feeling is that in England some people have been too keen to attribute their own failures to a perceived class barrier of their own construction which expresses itself as a dislike of the middle classes a nevertheless real divide that can be traced back to the Norman invasion and the creation of a them and us society My ancestors include subsistence farmers teachers miners and an architect Scotland was historically a much more egalitarian society As the Scots are fond of saying Were all Jock Tamsons bairns,122,2,0.01639344262295082

A former British ambassador in Syria has expressed an excellent dispassionate and rational point of view on the situation of chemical weapons attack in Syria Without evidence and with no research the media has launched their psychological warfare on people to make them back another catastrophic adventure by the West in that region The CIA and associates in Europe are vastly experienced in creating the kind of narrative they are publicizing everywhere now Many politicians from different sides have readily come to back the USA and their aggressive stand Syrias huge oil and gas reserves have attracted the interests of Turkey and Qatar intend to build a gaseoduct through Syrias territory to provide gas to Europe the dominant powers in the European Union in order to reduce their dependence on Russian gas and together with the USA as a way of overcoming the lingering crisis they are suffering Furthermore Syria is a strategically geopolitical centre for the control of trade towards Africa Asia and Europe Syria is key to control the whole of the region and their oil and gas reserves,181,3,0.016574585635359115

Every single proponent of privatization whether it be in utilities railways or healthcare always claims that it will lead to a better more efficient service or at least a cheaper one But it almost never works out that way Why Because introducing the private profit motive into what should be a public service always diverts spending away from providing services and into the pockets of shareholders Which leads to private companies spending the bare minimum on staff equipment and maintenance without lowering prices for the public Prices in many cases have actually risen dramatically  see railways water rates electricity and gas prices to name a few So no privatizing the NHS even partially is not going to reduce healthcare spending Its actually going to do precisely the opposite Ok so the government outlay might be lower if they can somehow avoid giving huge subsidies to private companies  another disease of privatization that doesnt reduce government spending by much in reality But the cost of buying private health insurance will certainly be a lot more per head of population than it currently costs us in taxes to fund the NHS The only possible way to avoid that is to deny coverage to high risk groups  the elderly or those with chronic or preexisting conditions Which is politically unacceptable and is also precisely the problem the NHS was created to avoid,229,3,0.013100436681222707

I concur when i was watching I think we can gain some much needed support if we dropped such opposition to leaving but campaigned as much into getting the best deal out of leaving the EU This however may include trying to retain access to the single market which even though we know remain campaigns tried frightening voters to vote remain by saying wed leave the single market also it doesnt make it any worse than putting it on the side of a bus ,84,2,0.023809523809523808

Once upon a time on a planet long lost in the midst of time there were no borders there was a little rock on the edge of this world which was thought magical So much so that people made long arduous journeys to get to it The Celts came mostly from Iberia the Romans the Angles Saxons Jutes the Normans and the Norse Then later came Jews Poles Hungarians Hugenot French Irish Italians Africans Asians many many more Each contributed to that land intermarried and made a lump of insignificant rock on the Edge of the world a great power Because there were no borders people travelled around this planet and worked together to create great cities great art great science But apparently that was considered immature so the people decided to isolate themselves instead by cutting off the little rock building walls in other places to keep out Others and deriding Unions designed to bring them closer together it remains to be seen where this will take that planet and the little rock but it does not bode well,180,2,0.011111111111111112

Dear Green Party folk  I am writing this in all honesty in a spirit of openminded enquiry and Id appreciate your thoughts I have always voted Labour I want to support Labour but I fear Labour has become unelectable now for reasons I dont need to outline here I approve of the Green Partys policies and philosophies but in my constituency a vote for the Greens is effectively a vote for the vile Tory sitting tenant I really am torn Can the Greens truly affect politics culture and society in the UK Facebook pages speak to the alreadyconverted on the whole  how can the Green message enlighten those on the right I need to feel optimistic about something The world is defeating me,123,5,0.04065040650406504

Hi there firstly welcome its great to see more pragmatism between people to vote on what they feel is right and not because of inherited voting or because of a few figureheads It does depend on your constituency if yours is a safe seat for any politician then a vote for the greens if you see fit makes sense as it wont let one or the other in The main problem we have with British politics is FPTP voting system that pits voters to vote tactically and not for what they want in fear of letting their least liked candidate win A vote for green can put pressure on other candidates to adopt stances such as vote reform and environmental protections In a swing seat this is compounded as the other parties will pander for your vote more and are more likely to change a their stances that would enable changes for the better Of course this is all optimistic as we all know politicians have a habbit of saying one thing and doing the opposite Which is why the greens are different because the green party is about green politics people power and true grassroots movements which make it easy to ensure green candidates are held to account which is only for reassurance mind you as a green candidate would themselves be fearce advocates for what they believe in which is usually putting people and planet first I hope this helps and I maybe back with more if I can think of anything else ,255,4,0.01568627450980392

As a Green Party sympathiser I was not impressed by Jonathan Bartley In a cowardly manner like all the panellists he played to the crowd was afraid to speak truth and demonstrated a lack of insight on two key populist issues On Syria not a single panelist had the courage to question what Assads motive could possibly be  on the eve of burgeoning peace talks  for a chemical weapons attack of this sort No the line was hes a monster and we hate monsters He done it  despite a lack of clear evidence green lighting cruise missile attacks by the US now and a dangerous ramping up of global tension Did anyone ask whether the attack could have been set up by Isis Al Qaeda or by factions within Assads military a hit on terrorist chemical weapons cache or a false flag operation involving say the CIA whose record speaks volumes Did any panelist mention Mosul and how this covers up the death of civilians probably in the thousands there over recent months which instead of being portrayed as heinous crime is presented as a delicate military operation On Livingstone there was one clear baying crowd truthspeak a philosophically convoluted and ultimately untenable line of fear Abbott at least understood that Livingstone would likely win in court that Livingstone who has spent his life fighting racism at its core has the temerity to challenge the racist power of zionist ideology and the evil apartheid prison state of Israel which has been in breech of the UN over decades including illegally possessing nuclear weapons Being Jewish doesnt give you the right to speak for all Jews There are many Israelis and Jews across the world who are deeply critical of zionist ideology and the Israeli state and are also aware of the complexities of pre WWII deal with wealthy zionists in Germany who arguably had the opportunity to help Jews in Germany under Hitler but chose not to Livingstone has always been extremely careful not to conflate being Jewish with zionism it may soon become a crime not to  understand the implications of the US December 2016 Antisemitism Awareness Act but has not been afraid to confront the inhumane Israeli State The using of Jewish people generally in this manner as a political tool by right wing zionists and proIsraeli state actions is the real antisemitism The Green Party at least should have the courage to call it out,408,16,0.0392156862745098

As usual subtlety and discretion is required re school absences which is something governments seem to have a problem with Why they cant leave it up to the head teachers to decide on a case by case basis I dont know,41,1,0.024390243902439025
I do have one question about the press release it states that   the Government should be enacting legislation against holiday companies who ramp up prices in school holidays well beyond the reach of ordinary families Any company that has a product that is seasonal will have higher prices when the demand is high and lower prices when the demand is low They charge what they can get away with like any other company What sort of legislation do we suggest to fix this Will this mean that I can afford the Bahamas this year,94,0,0.0
I disagree with my own party on this  state education is a social contract and will disintegrate if every parent asserts their right to do what they want This complainant has said its not about the price of holidays so its unclear what his problem is apart from being told what to do by a school Fines may be a blunt instrument but the principles are sound,67,0,0.0
I agree that fines and especially Jail are not the answer to parents taking kids out of school during term times But it can be very detrimental to a childs education particulalry if there are other problems ie speaks a different language they are trying to overcome too I think some days away should be allowed but I also think that each childs specific circumstances should be taken into account too and sometimes the parent doesnt even know what that is To sum up I really hope this proposal is discussed with teachers from all kinds of backgrounds and that you take thier advance on this,106,6,0.05660377358490566
I dont think we should take children out anytime we feel like it I do however think head teachers should be able to use their discretion to do so For me the cost of term time holidays isnt really the issues Yeah is costly in the holidays but my issue is that not all schools have the same holidays some siblings are in different schools My husband has set holidays so his leave next year doesnt fall in the summer like many other parents Also the same rules dont apply in Wales Scotland or Northern Ireland and also dont apply to private schools We should all be the same surely,110,6,0.05454545454545454

My problem is that this appears only to apply to children in state schools so the richest people get the cheapest holidays Also that if the government dictate when children are in school then they should dictate when the schools have holidays One of this mans problems was he had children in different schools with different holidays  and yes I realise this would not help the price of holidays,69,1,0.014492753623188406
Sorry but youll learn far more as a kid while on holiday than at school for any given week It clearly enhances them and Id much rather give them that experience than have my children turn into yet another degree educated clone When something is done about the horrendous prices they charge for holidays outside of termtime which wont ever happen because its good for the economy  or the Tories back pockets in other words maybe then Id think again,80,2,0.025
John Platts daughters attendance was around 92 and so was classed as a persistent absentee Im a headteacher havent used fines and dont agree with fining parents However this arrogant father is problematic as some kind of peoples champion He talks about parents rights I am interested in childrens rights Not least their right to an education Parents dont own their children they have the responsibility to bring them up and the joy of them And as for learning more on holiday and abroad he took her to Disneyland  pure entertainment and hardly a seminal educational experience As for a weeks missed school not mattering it can involve the introduction practice and application of a key concept,117,6,0.05128205128205128

Adam Kidd It doesnt matter how many MPs you have when considering alliances It matters how much support a party has in each constituency Even though Greens vote tally is quite low in most constituencies polling data suggests that Greens actually have significantly more support than the votes suggest FPTP is hindering the Greens moreso than any other party So for example in one constituency three parties Labour Greens and Lib Dems could have talks and arrange on open primary where local constituents can attend hustings debates to choose the candidate It could result in the Green candidate being chosen by the members from all parties Then what happens is all three parties in the constituency actively campaign for the Green candidate to win Repeat this in as many constituencies as possible I predict only a handful of constituencies will do this Tribalism stands in the way,147,4,0.027210884353741496

As a majority of Labour constituencies voted for Brexit are the Green Party really suggesting they should ignore the people they are supposed to represent Also add to the mix that some of the most pro EU constituencies are also Labour seats Seems they are in an impossible position regarding the EU,52,1,0.019230769230769232

Brexit means leaving the EU That means leaving all of its institutions including the single market That was made very clear during the referendum campaign There was no choice of hard or soft Brexit just as there was no hard or soft Remain option The choice was in or out We chose out Regarding the re writing of 1000s of laws I presume you mean the Great Repeal Bill How else would the 1000s of EU laws be incorporated into UK law A vote on every one But I would not want to be in Corbyns position in deciding Labours EU policy For the Greens it is easy One MP in a very pro EU constituency and a party united in support of the EU,125,6,0.048

Remain quite obviously meant continue as were going now whereas there was no coherent info from any Leave faction on what we wanted in fact there were daily contradictions on what it would mean As for the Repeal Bill  yes the aim of any sovereign democracy should be for its parliamentary houses and judiciary to debate and vote on laws not pay at least per year for 35000 bureaucrats to carry out whatever Theresa May orders I agree that I wouldnt like to be in JCs shoes especially with the ridiculous media bias that means whatever he does hes attacked But these should be red line issues  enabling the Tories to decide not only the terms of Brexit but also the outcome regarding thousands of basic laws and rights without any parliamentary or judiciary oversight should never be an option,140,4,0.02857142857142857
No a vote to remain was not a vote for the status quo The EU is a stage in the European Project to create a single European state So what would remain mean Ever closer political and financial union leading to the effective end of the nation state in Europe Progressively ceding ever more sovereignty Giving up control of armed forces to the nascent EU Army Bailing out the Eurozone Joining the Euro Turkey joining in the coming decade Imagine if the vote had been to remain and a campaign was pushing against a hard remain The argument would be yes of course we accept the result but a hard remain was not what people voted for The Repeal Bill will transfer tens of thousands of laws as they are The only changes without parliamentary scrutiny we are told will be the removing of references to EU institutions Otherwise should every single one be debated And how many were ever voted on by Parliament before they were imposed None So the EU can impose any law or regulation without Parliament having a say but those very same laws cannot be transferred to UK law without a vote in Parliament But back to the point of the post Labour are just not in a position to emulate the Green Partys stance on the EU So respecting the referendum result but holding the government to account over the terms of the Brexit deal is probably the best any leader of Labour could do,251,4,0.01593625498007968

In fairness Corbyn has always had excellent ideas for Education he just never had the opportunity to get his ideas on the more mainstream political platform Perhaps it can be argued that not even he goes far enough but then my own educational ideas are probably a bit too radical for any political party eg get rid of all school types and have a single progressive type free and independent from political and private sector influence where teachers control the curriculum where children have a say where children are not so regimented and dogmatically guided where the idea that learning capability can be quantitatively determined and decided is removed and where learning is a coconstruction between learner and teacher although learning should not be reduced to the quality of the relationship between teacher and child among other ideas,138,3,0.021739130434782608

Teachers were in charge of everything at one point which itself followed devolution of education from the then powerful Catholic authorities till Governments decided in the 1980s that they knew the Education system and the curriculum better than teachers and decided to tell the teachers what children should be learning and then later on decided that they knew more about teaching than teachers themselves therefore telling the teachers the way to teach what children should be learning,77,1,0.012987012987012988
You have a fair point Amanda but who is to say that any approach really leads to obtaining a job Also in what way should real life knowledge be defined If were talking about skills based knowledge eg plumbing carpentry and so on then yes I agree and hence I believe in a split at a certain age between academia and learning a practical trade Yes I think introductory material of politics should be introduced to secondary schoolchildren but should it go beyond introductory material to GCSE level What if the child doesnt want to be a politician Sometimes when it comes to GCSEs children pick certain subjects not because they are really interested in the subject or want to be a mathematician geologist or whatever but because they can use those grades as part of satisfying entry requirements of college courses as colleges command usually a certain number of GCSEs for particular courses of interest which in itself is another area of debate,164,2,0.012195121951219513

Still think its somewhat hypocritical for the Green Party to preach on about Brexit and how it wants to go against a democratic vote considering it has spent a lot of time pushing for PR to replace FPTP With Brexit where one person gets one vote and all votes are equal unlike FPTP should be what the Greens should be pushing for But they see it as a chance to attracted Remainers who are having trouble coming to terms with the referendum Anyway if the Blairites were put in their place then the Labour Party would be a lot closer to the Greens,103,6,0.05825242718446602

Sorry I was mistaken Tanith Cheetham It is child tax which will be from today limited to 2 children There are exceptions and it will not affect those already claiming only new births I would worry that with the universal credit system child benefit may be pushed under the same legislation James Bajgar no system is full proof and I might assume that with a larger population in London and many who do not have English as a first language it might be more difficult to encourage people to apply for what they are entitled to I had a friend from Nigeria whos husband would not allow her to claim child benefit etc for fear of it being claimed back by the government These cultural hurdles are difficult to overcome so I can see how your thought on giving to all would help I just feel that giving a free meal to all is more like equality but not justice Treating everyone equally does not always get the same end result justice does,173,5,0.028901734104046242

Cheryl Atkins from experience private schools do not necessarily mean better teachers In terms of education it still stands that the biggest barrier to success is the own attitude of the pupil Myself I went to a fairly poor primary same for my first secondary but the education I got myself because I had desire is what allowed me to have a varied career in some innovate places switching whole fields of speciality Also what about the hundreds of private companies like hedge funds and other banking systems that benefited from their staff having received a free education Also teachers often do not receive much if anything more in terms of pay for working within the UK private sector Education betters society by creating intelligent people It also betters society by making them have a more prosperous future and hopefully less need to seek state aupport both through better being able to understand life such as biology classes teaching when they need to see a GP and when it is a Virus just take rest and stay away To being able to have a fulfilling work life Talking about the parents having avoided tax is completely off subject and unrelated Andy Haring luckier not necessarily As I said having worked in a variety of avenues including schools in wide spectrums of the population private doesnt mean better Also again the extra cost the cost of having to find places to the taxpayer is far greater for those that are pushed out of being able to afford a private education Already by paying for it they cut the costs to the statetaxpayer and the idea of if they cant afford it with VAT send them to state school is a blind one Oh and by the way I am not pro private I see education as a right more important than democracy how can you vote intelligently without an education How can you benefit society as a whole without it and I about as left as they come I just also happen to be a realist and believe In factual data,350,4,0.011428571428571429

I went to a private school and had a scholarship to cut the fees to make them affordable I also saw kids get kicked out of the school because the parents couldnt afford to pay the extortionate fees How is doing this fair In some areas the level of schooling is so poor that kids have no choice but to go to a private school to get a decent education I was in a state school beforehand and was 8 weeks ahead in my work load so they actually refused to give me any work to do  and that was in the top set Theyre not just for super posh super rich people  The government need to stop punishing the hard workers who slog their guts out to have any decent standard of living,134,2,0.014925373134328358
Exactly Nic its the same for any government from tories to labour they need to get the money from somewhere and it would be the hard workers I actually think that labour are far worse than tories cause theyre delusional All as bad as each other Its a novice idea in an ideal dream world but thats as far as it goes People need to stop living in dream land  at the detriment of other people,76,5,0.06578947368421052
Exactly Me and rich both work full time jobs that pay above the minimum wage and we have to live paycheck to paycheck with no help from the state why should we be penalised for working full time jobs when they only just cover the bills On benefits you get housing benefit food vouchers free council tax a year towards your gas bill reduced gym memberships plus many other benefits that working people can barely afford as it is  if even at all How is that fair Benefits are there as an emergency system theyre not an income and thats what the government seem to be forgetting Urgh I hate people ,111,5,0.04504504504504504
Reduced gym membership even Ive never heard that Not even when I dealt with benifits at the council But still there are people that do heavily rely on benifits and it depends what degree they get all that It is harder to get benifits though its next too impossible to get a council house where I live now And the governments are making cuts and making it harder to claim For example only child tax credit for two children max This I actually support this I dont understand why working class people support these ideas where is this money coming from I work 40 hours minimum wage and cant afford to not live with my parents and wouldnt qualify for 1p from the government  Not that I want to rely on the government but I work hard one day I hope to earn enough to live independently working hard and trying to support my family I dont want to be penalised by ideas like this Its not 100 the government its also the people and their hippy dippy ideas,179,9,0.05027932960893855

This is NOT an excellent idea at all Firstly there are a huge amount of people who work 2 or 3 jobs to send their children to private schools for a better start Theyre not millionaires They are ordinary people working their arses off to do right for their children Penalising the wrong people is NOT the answer YES every child needs to be getting proper decent food regardless of background in the same way that every child should get a decent education regardless of background But theyre not getting either now So go back to the reasons why some people are having to work their arses off to send their kids to private schools Why do they feel they need to do that If I had Children I would do the same There is the first fundamental problem with the entire education system and not just dinner time Teachers are working their arses off to get the grades that keep central government happy with fake stats that produces children that are poorly educated and not ready for the big world THIS IS NOT THE TEACHERS FAULT This is the crazy system of targets For FUCK SAKE targets Also Teachers need to be able to discipline too State schools have become unruly teachers have become terrified to actually teach and they work to a set criteria and syllabus thats not fit for purpose GCSESs and A Levels are worthless Truly worthless Again this is NOT the teachers fault Every year the government both Labour and Tory laud their policies as success by hailing 98 success rates in GCSE That tells me theyve failed miserably The world is ugly and in truth not all Children are academic Some have other innate skills outside of numbers and writing We all know this to be a self evident truth SO how can 98 pass a GCSE Because theyre too fucking easy and in some cases fudged to show success We then have a generation leaving school who cannot read or write properly or even add up Theresa May is about to spend billions on free schools Labour tell the whole of UK right now that that will be reversed immediately THAT MONEY will be used to bring true education standards back Free school meals cooked fresh daily by qualified and trained staff and not farmed out to the private enterprise that do hospital meals too Nutritionally starved diets at inflated costs,408,10,0.024509803921568627

I fail to see how it will hit us economically in real terms Remainers keep saying this but they dont look at the facts Worst case scenario and we get no deal and revert to the WTO Tariff The fall in sterling since Brexit has more than offset that in the relative drop in the price of our exports so even then well be better off and thats in a worst case scenario Who doesnt want to work with foreigners as you put it I want to work with foreigners even more so because its the EU and the world outside that little fortress that will matter in the 21st century This propensity to label antiEU people fascists is a false one and a bit of an insult to the memory of all those who suffered and died for not wanting to live in a German dominated Europe 75 years ago It also displays immaturity ignorance of the facts and intellectual suicide So does this fantasy idea that the misanthropic EU is somehow a bastion of cultural enrichment that must be fought for at any cost and benefits all our lives It isnt and it doesnt and the sooner that selfserving gravy train of the super rich derails and falls apart the better If we are going to be a successful party then we need to connect with real people with the cold hard facts Spidery platitudes from hideously overpaid upper middleclass MEPs in their safespaces just wont cut it any more unless of course we wish to remain on the fringes of British politics,265,14,0.052830188679245285
Its very easy to manipulate statistics to make a point which agrees with your stance The fact is that the EU is still the second largest economy behind only China The rise of China and India amongst others since 1973 is the reason for the lower percentage This by no way suggests the EU is doomed,56,0,0.0
The economic facts are as follows like it or not a large chunk of our national income is generated by the London banking sector from which at least four of the worlds biggest banks are upping sticks to the EUmore will follow eg Lloyds of London is now Lloyds of Brussels  a large proportion of our national wealth is held in an overinflated property market and much as everyone would love to see house prices drop a sudden crash would be a disaster  I cannot begin to explain how operating under WTO rules is MUCH worse than operating under EU rules  I suggest you research that one  I could go on but there is not time or space here As for exports we import parts and assemble stuff to export We do export financial services but see above re banks leaving London The EU is not a closed entity It is a trading bloc that has already has trade deals with the rest of the world and as a member so do wefor the next two years at least Which again begs the question why do we want to leave To which the brexiters reply because there are things wrong with the EU Which again begs the question as a major player in the EU why dont we try and do something about those issues instead of flouncing off in a hissy fit I never called anyone a fascist and everything you said in the rest of that paragraph is emotive nonspeak I could just as easily say its a betrayal of those who fought and died in WW2 to snub the peace and unity that the EU has brought to a once troubled regionthere have been many conflicts close to EU borders in the last 50 yearseg Bosnia but none within it To be a successful party we need to deal in realities and stay on the right side of history,322,13,0.040372670807453416
Emotive nonspeak accusations projected without a hint of irony You have not given one reason for your claims about WTO rules the main one being the tariff which we would easily absorb Anyway thats just a worst case scenario Your diversionary blither about the BoE and house prices has nothing to do with it Despite omitting the fact we run a trade deficit with Europe which will mean its more in their interest that we get a good deal I cant pick out one point that youve made to refute what Ive said As your extensive and superior knowledge of the subject cannot possibly be summarized in a Facebook discussion let us just agree to differ because Brexit is going ahead regardless,122,8,0.06557377049180328

Im not diverting anything Ive given you facts about the economic fallout that has ALREADY occurred let alone speculating about whats to come And why are you talking about the BoE What about Deutsche Bank Goldman Sachs HSBC etc You seem to be trying to make this personal and not offering anything to back up your claims As I said if you seriously think that WTO rules will be good for the economy I suggest you research  no sensible economist would agree with you Thats why I cant be bothered to write an essay explaining why  its laughable,98,9,0.09183673469387756
I didnt say WTO rules would be good for the economy as such I just inferred that we would suck up the tariff due to the lower value of the since the vote so we would be no worse off than we were before the vote Im not being personal its just that you announced The economic facts are as follows followed by a load of spurious conjecture surrounding the banking sector that was totally outside the parameters of the discussion and then closed off any further debate in true Bemoaner arrogance Thats whats laughable Like I said I dont want confrontation The behaviour of some people like Michael Howard is cringeworthy and an embarrassment and I understand this All I asked is that we put a stop to this childish selfrighteousness as though Remain supporters are the only people who are educated I am only educated to Bachelors level in Modern History with 2 of my Alevels in Economics and Politics so Im no guru However I think that gives me enough knowledge of the subject to make an informed decision without being derided as ignorant and uneducated I wish more so called progressives would practice what they preached and accept that it is ok for people to have different views on a subject without having a meltdown Caroline Lucas has announced that if people act like fascists we will call them fascists In literal terms I wholeheartedly agree However I hope she is not referring to those supporting Brexit because that would include Jenny Jones who could take her apart on sustainable economics in a heartbeat,268,13,0.048507462686567165
Its not conjecture about the banking sector  this is stuff that has already happened and certainly very pertinent to the discussion Calling me a bemoaner isnt making it personal My argument was simply firstly there is pretty much zero good reason economically for leaving the EU Secondly other issues with the EU wouldve been better served by us as a major player remaining and fixing them Many brexiters have bought into fascistlike rhetoriceg the Daily Fails sentiment that judges upholding British Law were enemies of the people Im aware that not all brexiters are fascists racists etc but xenophobia has definitely been a major thread in Leaves argument That cannot be ignored,112,9,0.08035714285714286

Our relationship with the EU as a whole is that of a trade deficit but this doesnt mean they need us more than we need them For example the crankshaft for a mini is cast in Eastern Europe then shipped to the UK for fine milling and finishing Then it is sent to Germany to be inserted into the engine Then the engine is sent to the UK for insertion into the Mini and then many of the minis are sent back across the channel for sale elsewhere in the EU WTO tariffs would apply to each stage of this making production far more expensive If I were trying to build up the motor industry in for example the Czech Republic would I want a tariff free deal for the UK Nope Id block one in fact because Id want to increase the likelihood that BMW will move the milling and finishing operation at a minimum to within the EU and preferably the final production as well And guess what Id have a veto over the deal So while it might suit the EU as a whole and countries like Germany to give us a good deal countries who dont have the same trading relationship with us may well see this as their opportunity to get in on the action,220,3,0.013636363636363636

Great Idea Huge amounts of unnecessary work are going on around the world simply to suit the 1 Less work hours means happier healthier people and more time for family and fulfilling pastimes Basically a better less stressed world It would pay for itself with the savings made in health costs and other costs related to running people into the ground in the name of unsustainable growth and profit  Less work hours also means MORE jobs for those without work We need a redistribution of work as much as a redistribution of wealth Its crazy that we have people getting sick from having too much work as well as people getting sick from having no work  Its nonsensical A change is gonna come,123,1,0.008130081300813009

It doesnt have the rest of us in mind because the Green Party doesnt realise how damaging its wild ideas would be if put in place An example is immediately ramping up minimum wage by over per hour as they said they wanted to do in the last election It might sound great on the face of it but it would cause people to lose their jobs and massively push up the price of goods that everyone buys  which means that increase would be going straight back to your employer when you buy things if they dont lay you off due to you now being unaffordable Obviously any factory can just move abroad where labour is cheaper taking their jobs and taxes with them I say all this whilst working in low paid job which is easily enough to cover my every day needs and allow me to save most of my wage anyway Another example is trying to completely get rid of fossil fuel and nuclear power plants It s just not at all realistic to expect to run a country entirely on windfarms since it is not always windy and we do not have the ability to store huge amounts of power for those nonwindy periods,208,5,0.02403846153846154

Kevin Billups  read the idea before being so sure you understand the implications No one is proposing forcing this on employers If anything it would be higher paid employees this would happen to at first Again  optional There are plenty of sectors of high skill economy where its completely feasible Any business that is making as low as 20 value on employee working hours is probably a poor business to begin with or a new not very established business It depends on the sector but high paid workers produce much more value to the business then they are paid as do low paid employees How many coffees does a Costa barista need to make to pay for their hourly average wage Not very many Which is why theres a Costa in every town in the country  they add much more value than they cost All businesses should earn more value from every employee than they provide Thats just a profitable expanding business The question is where that value goes If you are building a startup business and are giving yourself low wages that doesnt mean no value is being created it means the value is invested back into the business for future higher returns If you can afford to take on an employee and you are paying them poor wages then any value they are creating is again being used as value to help the business grow Paying poor wages is a choice not a necessity If you are paying your employees a salary below their market rate then they are giving you charity  its that simple That charity may be fine with both them and you but dont pretend its inevitable If it IS required then your business has much bigger problems than wages,295,7,0.023728813559322035

There is plenty of information out there showing that working less can be beneficial for peoples health try Googling it When were overworked were more likely to sleep less eat worse and skip exercise leading to a whole host of health issues These issues directly and negatively affect employers because they lead to absenteeism taking sick days high turnover rate quitting and rising health insurance costs Essentially in the long run employers get more out of their staff if they let them work 6 hours instead of 8 because theyll then employees take less full days off due to feeling ill httpwwwhuffingtonpostcomjonathanchan3scientificallybackedrb14509568html,102,3,0.029411764705882353
Gary Sutton I agree it probably is so but I am not looking for opinion scientific or otherwise which is all I have found so far What I need is actual research and statistics  which I havent yet found Opinion from experts and workers who worked rotating shifts said similar things about effects on health and longevity but actual reported sickness and time off short and long term said exactly the opposite,72,1,0.013888888888888888

That is a massive simplification of the problem The evidence suggests that a worker doing 6 hours a day gets as much done as one doing 8 hours which is a slightly different proposition to the one the Greens are proposing and I think a better one ie there is not a linear relationship between productivity and hours worked Now companies are free to ignore the evidence and make their workers do longer days for little to no benefit but think about this from a workers perspective Which company will the best workers want to work for  the one that has them work 6 hours a day or 8 for the same money So the companies that have shorter days will start attracting better workers who have higher productivity increasing the costproductivity ratio for those companies until such time as all companies have 6 hour work days A worker who has a better worklife balance will be a happier worker a happier worker takes less sick days and a happier worker is less likely to move to a different job Sick days cost the UK something like a year and having to train new staff means that both experienced and new members of staff work at reduced productivity rates further decreasing the costproductivity ratio,214,4,0.018691588785046728
Andrew Ward You made some good points It would be difficult if some businesses operated 4 days and other 5 days Perhaps shift work between employees could ensure the business operated the standard hours and days Like in many service industry jobs that cover 7 days a week If a 3 day weekend was introduced it would give employees more leisure time and create more job roles in the economy as more people would be needed to cover the other hours If people had more leisure hours it that could also boost leisure and entertainment sectors People would have more free time and energy to spend money Though employers might have some problems with managing more employees and perhaps extra costs and paperwork The benefits of happier healthier more productive employees might outweigh those problems though Google are well known for the shorter work weeks and employee perks and theyre rather successful ,152,2,0.013157894736842105
Sorry Benjamin Im not intending to come off aggressive possibly riffing a little off the first reply I would ask a counter question in a similar vein  when did I say it was new or a green idea I just said that while its a nice idea its a pipe dream And while you didnt quote a line from the article you did cite it to backup that its done everywhere else when in practice everyone who tried it abolished it after a couple of years  and of everyone from developing economies like Gambia to established ones like Utah do that it has to be a sign that theres a flaw to it Throw in the whole article 50brexit fiasco and were not in a position to be able to go yeah FranceAmericaGemany are working today but were going to take a day off And Mia Rumble I dont disagree with you that making people feel worthwhile is a massive thing Ive mentioned it on another post here but Ive worked two offices in the last few years In the first I was contracted 375 hours a week but was expected to work as many as it took to get the job done in practice with their godawful systems and terrible way of treating staff it took an average of 525 a week In my current office Im contracted to work 35 hours and until recently when we went from being a UK head office to the head office for Europe Israel and the West Bank I generally worked 3435 hours a week Now that were in the transition for the whole Europe thing Ive been working 50 hours a week to try to get my team integrated and up to speed as the stuff Im inheriting ran on a very different logic to what I do and wasnt administered very well But Im treated well trusted motivated rewarded for my work from the big stuff like pay risesbonuses to the small stuff like my name being called out in meetings for excellent customer support or even something as simple as my manager going youve been working 87 all week its Friday I dont want you here past 3 today All told Id rather work a 70 hour week where I am now than a 5 minute week in the old place,392,19,0.04846938775510204
Owen Bennett If youre quoting the study I saw it actually showed that someone who was at work 7 hours a day but took an hour worth of short breaks would still accomplish as much Cutting out a whole day would have a rather different effect As to sick days in my experience just treating your staff better cuts those down To reference the two offices I mentioned above in the crap one I didnt have to be feeling particularly bad to take a day off because they way they were treating me meant that I didnt want to be there that office was my first accounting job and when I left I honestly thought is that what works like why the hell would I want to do that every day With my current job Im working comparable hours now but the only way I take a day off is if I dont feel I can drive there safely If I can Ill go in even if I end up having to come home later because I want to be there Im doing a comparable role Im working comparable hours but one was exhausting the other is challenging me Like I said Id rather work 70 hours a week where I am than 5 minutes in that first office The biggest difference  the culture of the offices The first one was very blame oriented If you couldnt get the work done in time it was your fault even if it was a server crash or a total blackout There was no consideration that there werent enough resources or that the process was flawed it was your fault New office if I go I couldnt get it done then we look at why We might rearrange a process a priority list or look to see if we need more resources doesnt necessarily mean I can just go I need another person and get it but it would get seriously considered,329,11,0.03343465045592705

To answer your question I was addressing this I would like to see the Greens become more than a 1 MP1 Lord party this kind of thing will always hurt that the implication here sounding as if this is a typical green kind of thing but it wasnt the sum of my entire point so to focus on it specifically would be cherry picking Also to address your claim that I cited the article to back up that everywhere else is doing it that is a false statement As I said in my previous post my statement was that it wasnt a new revolutionary or Green idea By providing an article which itself is from 2013 and within provides previous examples of this issue arising such as 2008 in myriad countries from myriad groups I made a basis for it not being new revolutionary or Green The only other thing I stated was that other countries work shorter weeks which you may want to note is not the same as longer weekends this is a factual statement based on the amount of hours some countries work compared to others which also adds weight to the fact that its not revolutionary or new Actually in places like the US working hours used to be even longer but have declined from times like the Civil War Between 1913 and 1919 weekly hours fell by about 8 and in 1926 Henry Ford standardised the fiveday workweek instead of the previous and common six days This suggests that there might be a natural shift towards shorter working hours and it will especially come into play more and more in the modern world as automation increases What I did was make a simple statement and then provide the basis for it in order to generate further discussion What you did was react in a kneejerk fashion to go immediately on the attack perhaps because someone else had put you on the back foot but this isnt a helpful response I suggest if you want further reading on why some people advocate for even shorter hours now that you read things like the stuff below Again you do not have to agree with everything within and Im sure you will have arguments for the points they raise but it helps to expand ones knowledge rather than tearing everything down as soon as it comes up because its not your already accepted view 21 hours  Why a shorter working week can help us all to flourish in the 21st century httpswebarchiveorgweb20160209144546httpb3cdnnetnefoundationf49406d81b9ed9c977p1m6ibgjepdf New Economics Foundation Reduced Work Hours As a Means of Slowing Climate Change httpceprnetdocumentspublicationsclimatechangeworkshare201302pdf Center for Economic and Policy Research,444,12,0.02702702702702703

Julie Westbury The biggest flaw I can see in the whole shifting work is that while it works in the service industry where you have a table serve the table table leaves onto the next one so youre operating on very short time scales For me I work in Accounts Receivable for a major franchisor I have to build long term relationships with our franchisees and theres a lot of historic knowledge about how different peoples accounts are handled ongoing agreementsqueriesetc Right now Im in the middle of a twofold demonstration of how important historic knowledge is for my work The first is that Ive been promoted up to team leader and Im training a new clerk while we recruit for the 2nd new clerk and while I can hand across a lot of my processes quite easily handing across the historic knowledge so that she can build her own relationships with the franchisees At the same time I was handed Europe rather abruptly we were supposed to hand over from Feb to the end of May when the Paris office would close in practice that got massively accelerated so we went to Paris on 13th Feb and back on the 14th with the staff there only in the office until the 28th The biggest problem Im running into is that the European franchisees come to us and say Ive got an agreement that I wont be charged X or Ive got agreed payment terms of Y instead of your normal Z I dont have that historic knowledge so Im constantly having to say can you send me a copy of the agreement or emails where you got that which is tedious for me and incredibly annoying for them So while having a few people on a 3 day week with people tagging in and out might work in retailsalesgeneral customer facing work it wouldnt work properly in functions like accounts marketing quality assurance supply chain or legal,328,18,0.054878048780487805

Andrew its worth noting your job specifically has a much higher workload and responsibility level than average There may be many people with similar workloads and responsibilities around you because thats the environment you work in but overall you are in a very small minority Context for everyone else We know each other There is no such thing as a functioning preautomation economy that has more people in upper management positions than shop floor and manual labour ones Until drones go widespread and we actually end up fully abolishing a substantial portion of all jobs which I think is probably still a few years off Tesco for example will always need significantly more shop floor staff and store managers than they will need accountants and tech support guys And additionally when I worked tech support We got a lot of downtime especially on the night shift I distinctly remember sometimes we could go a full hour without receiving a single call to deal with Granted we needed several people there at all times to ensure 247 coverage but not all of our working hours were used productively I read most of A Song of Ice and Fire on my evening shifts there for lack of anything else to do yet frequently felt like I didnt get enough time to myself while spending 9 hours a day away from home and doing something that dozens of other people can do The 4day work week may not be ideal for every sector but it doesnt need be applied to all of them just as to my own ire unsociable hours pay isnt but would be more than valid to roll out to a substantial portion of jobs and if it were established as a social norm the benefits would be huge at the very least even if you wouldnt get an extra day off youd have to be offered overtime pay for one weekend day a week I respect the fact that you do a job very few other people are able to and which is close to impossible to hire someone else to do in tandem with you but I feel a 4day working week is both helpful and possible to millions of other people even if you sadly dont count among them,382,13,0.034031413612565446

Hi Jeremy it will mean our population rate can be managed again from within the UK For two decades between the 70s to early 90s the UK population increase was around 50000 a year meaning much less drastic urban growth with hence less development pressure on wild places and wildlife Perhaps its this level which would be best it was proved to work for 20 years whilst allowing for skilled employees But the EU have always made it very clear  Allow full freedom of movement despite the consequences or leave the EU There wasnt ever a hope of any change of that Surely the UKs long term environment wildlife and sustainability which we bequeath our children must come higher than short term considerations of economic profit or costless trade access,130,4,0.03076923076923077

Ok since you cant see the connection Ill explain it for you In the Brexit vote a majotrity voted for Brexit The minority who lost the vote continue to complain about it and in my view they are within their rights to do so At the Green Party Conference which only a fraction of the membership are able to attend a majority voted for Progressive Alliance guff The minority who oppose it will continue to complain about the result,79,4,0.05063291139240506
And that is why i also dispute the referendum cause a constitutional change needs at least 23rds of the vote to proceed this is a policy vote where they have to meet a quorum to vote which has been agreed upon many times with policy voting so youre saying we should have 23rds of membership to vote Wed never get anything done And also Im not keen on the progressive alliance but the policy has still left it upto local parties to decide Next time you comment dont be so patronising,91,7,0.07692307692307693

Which part of that is made up,7,0,0.0
The part where they say  thats what the establishment wants How do they know that the establishment wants to make you feel hopeless They provide no evidence of this Do they really think that politicians have spent all their life working their way to the top of government in a democratic country with the whole intention of making everyone feel hopeless on purpose It is absurd that they even suggest that and just makes the Green Party seem desperate and jealous of the government just because they hold power and arent left wing,93,2,0.021505376344086023
Im guessing the austerity cuts have somehow bypassed you And Trump has got a blatant disregard for Science and fact in his profit over environment bullshit Im guessing you think this is some conspiracy though,35,2,0.05714285714285714
No you seem to be missing what the Green Party is saying They are saying that the establishment wants to make people hopeless  as though the government has sat down had a talk with the sole aim of how to make people hopeless and then implemented decisions to make sure that they have no hope Thats just nonsense Do you seriously think leaders have sat there and said I think the best way to destroy hope is through service cuts Of course not Thats why its a conspiracy theory The conspiracy that is being made up is that a group of people have worked their way into power and their only intention is to purposely ruin peoples lives,118,2,0.01694915254237288
Fair point on the Establishment aspect but you take no account of what the establishment actually is or the rise of the career politician over the last twenty years and the rise of national party ideologies above all else Consider just two things The power of the rightwing press to adversely control the politicians and public eg Enemies of the People headlines and the revolving door between MPs and big business interests eg G Osbournes latest job with the ES even though his current status as an MP is in conflict with this an his other four jobs,98,5,0.05102040816326531
Also although the democratic agencies may not have sat down to destroy hope there has been a divide and rule mentality in the Conservative Government highly abetted by the rw press to deflect from what is the cause of the bigger problems At least the Green Party see the sense of sustainability Universal Living Wage etc whilst many of the old hands of the Tories still have a outmoded and Victorian view that there are the deserving and the undeserving poor Think IDS and the cuts in state benefits and the way it is assessed by a private company who have a financial incentive to reduce the burden to the state As we go through the process of leaving the EU I think there might just be a realisation of a new reality that our current and future discontent is not about regaining our democracy immigration Islamic extremists or inability to fund the NHS because of the Brussel Bureaucrats or spongers like NFarage or socalled austerity Hopefully a new order will emerge albeit not in my lifetime and the Green Party and the Ecology Party before them have and will play a significant part in that transformation to a fairer and sustainable society that does indeed work for all including the likes of Mz Kozlowski below,216,7,0.032407407407407406

Indeed it is a coup bloodless so far but a coup nonetheless and it has been a long time in the preparation  Brexit is merely a means to this end I think the Green Party is right to articulate this but here be dragons there is a great danger that this can look outrageous and hysterical although it is true to most people and especially to the dominant right wing press who can then further consign the Green Party to a slightly batty little niche that can be ignored I dont think that we should be ruled by the right wing press ever but if we are to reach out beyond our natural supporters we need to be sure that we communicate these difficult things in ways that do not scare people off Finally in this paragraph the far right generates and uses hysteria to disrupt and cause chaos and we must be careful not to get down into that gutter with them Finally in this post what the coup plotters are now salivating over  and it is their intended target I believe  is the bill to repeal all the EU legislation In repealing this they will slide in draconian laws which will curtail freedoms remove protections and transfer morepower away from the law and the judiciary This is the most dangerous moment of all far more dangerous to us than Brexit,232,4,0.017241379310344827

I find it incredulous that any leader would want to take our country down such an unknown risky path with potentially massive negative consequences for the economy our influence in the world and our society purely on the outcome of a single referendum which was founded on lies The referendum itself was incredibly poorly thought out in terms of the rules of engagement with no governance such as a minimum threshold for what could be considered the will of the people or the need for proper assessment of the actual consequences of staying in and leaving the European Union On top of that there will likely not be another vote once some negotiations have happened to determine if Britain actually really does want to break from the EU when the consequences have been explored and are better understood Games show contestants are given the opportunity to change their mind or phone a friend yet in this massively significant event affecting everyones lives and future we are not,167,1,0.005988023952095809

Oh its just great isnt it The referendum came about after a shitshow of a disinformation campaign following decades of antiEU propaganda and antimigrant demonisation in the rabidly rightwing tabloid press It was a nonbinding advisory referendum and was far too close to call But somehow Brexit is going ahead lead by a bunch of inept but spiteful and authoritarian selfserving Tories who really havent got a clue what they are doing but are intent on making sure that everything fits THEIR agenda Lots to be really happy about here isnt there,92,11,0.11956521739130435

Lena I would really like to know when and how I am supposed to work to get the best outcome for the country I am not a Tory and the likelihood is that I will not agree that their version of Brexit is the best for this country even if I agreed with leaving the EU in principle Say that for the sake of argument I accept the referendum result and genuinely want to make it work  how do I oppose the government without being accused of trying to wreck Brexit oppose the will of the people acting against the countrys interests etc etc etc And how in all conscience can I support the government when I am totally opposed to its ideology and methods,125,6,0.048
Teresa Wilson Good point and I will try to answer that assuming the vote was the other way and I disagreed with the direction the government was taking Assuming your support is in favour of success of this country as an ultimate goal without self interest or an emotional affinity to Europe it would be a good idea to contribute ideas on how the government can support businesses or improve legislation going forward Instead of insisting its fair to pay an exit charge as a penalty for being the odd man of Europe I would suggest making a contribution to businesses who will have to operate according to WTO rules Another suggestion is to make Britain attractive to future investors and support subsidies for the industries that will suffer the most from our exit Lobbying MPs for constructive measures is more beneficial than complaining and halting the process Its best to assume a no deal situation and go from there,160,1,0.00625

Voting for Leave gave a free ride and a leg up to the hard right and Im continually astonished that people could not see that and could not see the danger Even worse there were members of the Green Party who did not see that and thought that the EU counted only for the economic benefits it might or might not deliver Moreover if any of them had any awareness of the history of warfare in Europe they will have known that the 20th century was the bloodiest and most violent in human history with millions of people slaughtered in Europe as well as elsewhere on the planet in two world Wars that started in Europe They would also have known that the EU has grown painfully and haltingly out of a determination among European nations that such a slaughter must never happen again and that this was one of the principle underpinnings of the EU and one of its main benefits The EU had and has many things that are very wrong with it eg the Euro as well as things that are very right but as long as we are all inside the same tent we are less likely to slaughter each other or start another world war And as long as we stick together others beyond the EU are similarly less likely to assault us and start killing  literally or figuratively And if we dont stick together and work together we have no chance of dealing in any serious way with the effects of climate change Shame on those myopic Green Party supporters who could not work all this out or thought it relatively unimportant And shame on all the fuck you voters who wanted to vent their infantile rage at the establishment by handing over control to something even worse,304,4,0.013157894736842105

This party is a joke why join a party that has no chance of ever being in power and believes in a magic money tree bankrupting Britain and destroying the economy with it borrow borrow spend spend spend like xmas has come early approach A party for loony toons and crazy clowns and green monsters with no brain,58,2,0.034482758620689655

But consider that UKIP played a huge role in securing Brexit and at most they only had one MP,19,3,0.15789473684210525

Jamil which is pretty much what they said about Labour in the first decade of the 20th century,18,2,0.1111111111111111
Well go and speak to UKIP supporters about that then As I said I voted remain but I know its a very stupid idea to try and overturn a vote especially on an issue as big as this one Just look at what happened in Ukraine when they ousted a president that was voted in properly for example Thats why I think the Green Party is wasting their time trying to go against the majority decision of people to vote to leave If the majority of people had voted to remain I think its very likely UKIP would be campaigning very hard for a second referendum I also think it would be a certainty that the Green Party would be demanding that they respect the result of the referendum  something the Green Party is not willing to do when the shoe is on the other foot They pretend to be prodemocracy but they clearly arent when the votes dont go in their favour,163,6,0.03680981595092025

Thats great but could you spend some time fixing the roads in Brighton since theyve been neglected for decades Driving through town requires a Humvee these days,27,3,0.1111111111111111
stop moaning you should try cycling it Roads are being ground down by heavier and heavier 4x4 use Who fault is that ,22,1,0.045454545454545456
Four wheel drive doesnt make a squit of difference Same amount of torque applied over a greater number of wheels Engine produces X torque each wheel Y exerts force equal to XY Range Rover Sport produces 1500 T which is 375 T per wheel in 4x4 or 750 T per wheel in 0x2 2x750  1500 4x375  1500 1500  1500 Its the same number Arguably since this torque is applied over the road contact area 4x4 drive provides LESS wear on the road surface since its the same force divided over a greater area These are road surfaces designed to last whilst being used by HGVs which weigh in a great deal more than any 4x4 and yet somehow its just the 4x4s that are at fault Did you go to one of those schools which managed to somehow skip over basic arithmetic or is it just possible youre spouting off because you think 4x4 are bad because of the dolphins or whatever cause celeb is faddy and havent actually done any reading Besides how is that a counter argument They shouldnt fix the roads because they need fixing If you require a 4x4 to drive on Brighton roads are you not forming a suprious circular argument 4x4 make the roads bad so you need a 4x4 to drive which makes the roads bad so you need a 4x4 etc etc Even if you went with you false assertion that 4x4 vehicles damage the road excessively how does that equate to not needing to fix them,255,25,0.09803921568627451

The primary motivating factor in 4x4 sales is crash safety specifically the survivability for back seat children So if youre dead set on blaming people point the finger at those pesky parents who selfishly want their kids to have a better chance of surviving a crash Also probably escaped you but road repair is based on Road Tax of which 4x4 users pay a proportionatly higher rate making the point irrelevant Brightons roads are shitty its the councils responsibility to fix them they are not doing so,87,5,0.05747126436781609
Ben TheHat its also a funding issue as councils are starved of funds they have to use money where it is needed most and that will always be health and education rightly so Councils here in Devon seem to do lots of ineffective temp repairs which only last a month or two sadly our whole infrastructure is underfunded this isnt just a Brighton problem ,64,2,0.03125
Great weve identified that other things cost money here and in other parts of the country that take priority That doesnt mean that something as basic as keeping the roads in good order and essentially safe to drive or cycle on as the pot holes on some roads have the potential to ruin cars and kill cyclists Greens dont give a shit about car owners and would have everyone trot around on unicorns made of quinoa if they could,79,4,0.05063291139240506

Michael Hance The SNP repeatedly over and over again assured us that a 2nd referendum would wait on a change of opinion on the question of separation by the Scottish people or on their demand the Scottish peoples demand for a 2nd referendum  neither of these changes of opinion among the Scottish people have manifested  opinion polls show that the population are no more enchanted by separation than they were in the recent independence referendum and in fact that an even higher proportion are against having a 2nd referendum foisted on them in the time scale proposed demanded  by the Scottish Parliament But thank you for correcting my typo  I am content that while the SNP is blind to its democratic deficit in this matter British constitutional law will prevail against the UR Latin prefix FASCIST bellowing of minority SNP and their dupe side kicks who allow that Party to pretend that THEY ARE the Scottish people I will support the calling of an inderef 2 when a majority of Scottish people support it You are welcome and entitled to support an inderef 2 Mr Hance but at present and on the demanded time scale an inderef 2 is against the wishes of the majority of Scottish people I am a democrat Mr Hance you are an ideologue a reasonable enough position at times  I would suggest that the SNP while possessing a certain ideology has no real political ethic and in practice has little regard for democracy An inderef 2 being highly divisive and so utterly fundamental in its import and consequence must wait on the wish of the Scottish people to hold it NOT on the ambition of impatient SMPs sinking under their record and desperate for a punt ,291,15,0.05154639175257732

Hi Miles you can have a quick look a wikipedia to find out what is meant by global citizenship I guess if you like you can choose to call yourself a citizen only of some country  personally I prefer not to classify by physical location or to judge worthiness of aid of a person based on that or any other physical factor or financial means for that matter How can you say that about our resources Do you know about government spending Can you provide your sources In reference to your previous comment  you seem to have judged J Bartleys entire speech and effort on this short clip He didnt say anything about anyone else being nasty or whatever He listed a lot of oppressed groups because they are oppressed Your words They need support from everyone I dont understand your stance if you could enlighten me to the nature of your views I would seriously like to know since maybe im missing a crucial source of information,168,5,0.02976190476190476
Sure Citizenship is a legal status It means you are part of the legal structure of a state You are the beneficiary of its protection and you contribute taxes In the simplest possible terms Consider everything you get from British Citizenship What do you get for being a citizen of the world What benefits What legal and military protection What infrastructure and economic benefits do you get Citizenship isnt something to take for granted Just because people have advantages and disadvantages it doesnt follow that they are oppressed We cant just take millions upon millions into this country,98,2,0.02040816326530612
What do you mean what do I mean our resources Are you opposed to the concept of ownership,18,0,0.0
Yes citizenship is a legal status  however I dont think legal status is what Bartley is referring to What do you mean what do you get I havent thought about it nothing material it is perhaps a label of a state of openness justness connectedness  why do you ask what you get What do you lose Correct just because you have certain advantagesdisadvantages doesnt mean you are oppressed But oppressed peoplegroups are oppressed by definition Right So we should work against the oppression of oppressed peoplegroups right Maybe we cant just take millions upon millions Although I am not an economist I dont actually know  maybe we can Are you an economist No I am not opposed to the idea of ownership but who exactly is this weour,128,8,0.0625
Well if you havent thought about what you get for your citizenship try renouncing it and see what happens You would be stateless and loose the right to live in the country for a start Nothing material What about benefits Actually an oppressed group is only oppressed by definition if you define them as such People in North Korea are oppressed Im not sure the same can be said for many of the people who identify as oppressed groups in the UK or Europe Its dangerous because it comes from the Marxist notion of oppressors and oppressed which creates a victim narrative which people can use to justify all kinds of immoral behaviour even violence,115,2,0.017391304347826087
As for how the economics of mass immigration reducing world poverty its hopeless httpsyoutubeLPjzfGChGlE,14,1,0.07142857142857142
Miles we were just talking about global citizenship now youre telling me about British citizenship If a group is not oppressed then you do not call it oppressed right But you identified oppressed groups in your original post Yes people in North Korea are oppressed I dont know who identifies as oppressed in UK but are you arguing against yourself You identified oppressed groups Well that video is really sad but we werent even talking about reducing world poverty,79,3,0.0379746835443038
Im telling you about British citizenship because it is a real thing Global citizenship is not a real thing Its just rhetoric Citizenship pertains to a state not a planet I refer to oppressed groups because that is how the Left identifies them that doesnt mean I agree that every member of that group is oppressed or even that oppression is in any way an accurate description of the challenges they face Oppressed and oppressed is the marxists idea from the communist manifesto which in the context of Tsarist Russia where most people were Serfs had a point In North Korea its relevant In the first world in countries like the UK and US no it bloody well is not The video illustrates the utter futility of trying to help people in less fortunate countries simply by bringing them into western countries It wont make the slighted dent in the issue The important point is that defining people into identity groups lumping them all together and saying theyre all victims who are oppressed and we need to stand up to the evil oppressors whoever they are is completely fucking stupid,190,4,0.021052631578947368
I know about British citizenship and I disagree with you about global citizenship being rhetoric Miles you brought up the whole point about oppression right Bartley is listing groups in this short clip he also says young old as groups but theyre not oppressed in general Do you mean bringing people from less fertile lands wont help those countries yeah Not the people that fortunate enough to move Fine I agree with that last point but who said that,79,1,0.012658227848101266
You inhabit the globe that doesnt make you a citizen Bringing people from the Middle East and Africa into this country will be good for them but the question is will it be good or bad for us And the evidence shows that in the UK and Europe it does far more harm than good Thats why people voted Brexit Thats why political support is moving to the right everywhere because the Left refused to deal with the problems caused by immigration and dismissed the people who brought it up as being bigots and racists,95,4,0.042105263157894736
Yes correct no qualms on first point there is no legal definition of global citizenship You can consider yourself a global citizen as I do Did you read the wiki article I think the question should be how can it be best for everybody Which I know is an extremely difficult one to answer But dont you agree on that Can you show me your evidence Id like to see it I dont agree that the problems are dismissed with allegations of racism But again very open to seeing evidence I think tax avoidance is a bigger problem for the UKs resources 36billion pounds missing last year than helping dyingoppressed people around the world This is overlooked and blame for problems placed on poor vulnerable people when clearly the biggest tax avoiders cause the biggest problems,136,6,0.04411764705882353

Ok Care to answer my questions above,7,1,0.14285714285714285
Cultural assimilation or lack thereof Wages for working class people being reduced by an influx of cheap labour Cultural tensions from communities with different values and regressive attitudes toward women gays atheists and free thinkers just off the top of my head,42,0,0.0

What is this list Is this your evidence Can you show me any reports research To my knowledge in the UK most of the regressive attitudes and acts come from UK nationals against these groups I will very happily educate myself with proper research I am honestly interested in where your opinionsbeliefs come from In my experience all my friends from around the globe invite me to join their traditions as they are welcome to and do join in with mine,81,1,0.012345679012345678
You sound like someone who has never even spoken to someone who voted Brexit about why they voted that way,20,1,0.05
Which list The towns are places where Muslim immigration has most obviously caused harm to the communities The reasons are the ones given by people who voted Brexit,28,1,0.03571428571428571
And whilst there is a small farright fringe many people who arent bigoted or racist at all have been tarred by the same brush by the left who conflate legitimate concern about cultural assimilation from large numbers of people with radically different and comparatively regressive attitudes and values with racism and bigotry,52,2,0.038461538461538464
Ok I have spoken to a few  I guess Im speaking to another now The more opinionsdebates the better right Anyway any elaboration on the above,26,3,0.11538461538461539
What do you want me to elaborate on Ive just told you why people voted Brexit because unlike you Ive actually listened to them,24,3,0.125
Sorry my last post came a bit late I see your point but I think it is a bit hypocritical to generalise what the left do and how they think collectively to say that in general they say that anyone who disagrees with them is racist or bigoted I have listened and have yet to see any compelling evidence that is what Im looking for  and you seem to know something I dont and you arent sharing it with me,80,3,0.0375
I simply cannot believe anything anyone tells me about important issues like this like the things youre talking about without compelling evidence If you or anyone else can prove these hypotheses they will become fact until then its more like hearsay,41,1,0.024390243902439025
Its not hypocritical to generalise about a group of people who generally have a similar view Now look  we arent having a formal debate Im not about to start citing studies and statistics for every point Im making This isnt a hypothesis its public opinion Clearly you are out of touch with it,53,4,0.07547169811320754
Im wondering why do you think people voted Brexit And before you go there its not an argument from ignorance fallacy because Im not using it to defend my position Id actually just be interested to hear why you think people voted Brexit,43,4,0.09302325581395349
Ok what I meant to address is that you said the left call people who are concerned about cultural changes racist Thats is clearly not true How do you know what public opinion is if you have no way of measuring it You cant possibly know without finding out You simply cannot just make a statement and claim it as fact Which you have done over and over again And in any case what does public opinion reflect about reality  history shows that it is very little It may not be formal but it is serious however I cannot take your arguments seriously As I have said I am interested in wherehow your opinions are derived You have not given any indication which leads me to believe you dont have factual bases for your statements You have shown no interest in my opinion which gives the impression that you dont want to gain as much information as possible and in that case you cant make the best case,168,5,0.02976190476190476

The Daily Mail gets women to write articles like this on purpose as they think it will undermine those who complain However I bet the writer was not expecting the editor to put it on the front page with that headline The legs are irrelevant and shows utter disrespect of both the women and no serious look at the politics they represent Once again the Daily Mail shows its true colours if women forget their place and have the temerity to rise to the top they should be publicly demeaned so that other women will be put off doing the same and certain men can heave a sigh of relief that all is right in the world once again,119,0,0.0

The problemwith being antinuclear power is that fossil fuels are running out and renewables are at least 20 to 25 years away from being efficient enough to cover all our power needs It would be nice if solar panels on an average house were enough to provide all that houses electrical requirements during a 24 hour period but unfortunately they are nowhere near efficient enough and so the shortfall has to come from the national grid We will soon be facing a shortfall between the electricity this country requires every day just to function and the electricity that this country actually generates Without something to fill that shortfall we face increasingly regular power cuts,114,3,0.02631578947368421

They do have more support but not to the degree that they get coverage The fact that the Leave campaign was given 50 airtime by the BBC despite never getting close to 50 until the end is itself an example of their false balance Yet they gave the Tories 70 coverage so presenting it as a battle within the Tories between those that just wanted out and those that saw Europe as a negative transaction for the sake of maintaining access to the single market Eurocynics vs Eurosceptics,88,3,0.03409090909090909
Common sense never makes good headlines  TV so the media arent interested in the Greens With UKIP however its like Xmas every day for them The media need to realise and acknowledge that they have a responsibility in this and that what they do is effectively boost the hate propaganda The public also needs to refrain from clicking on those links to scandals and sensational rubbish The fewer the hits the fewer the articles Click on what you want to see more of,83,2,0.024096385542168676

Is it fair Perhaps this is the wrong question to ask Is it to be expected The difference between the two parties in question is that UKIP were gaining momentum and were a threat to big three The Green party cannot achieve that and therefore does not get the same media airtime In my humble opinion this is because the Greens lose a lot of credibility with an image partly justified of being activists first and politics second This is reinforced by an appetite to protest on matters that are either trivial or unsound For example I was asked to attend a meeting at the concern over the investments being made in water services for Manchester The Northwest being the centre of excellence for drainage designmanagement in the world who lead the way in this field This is like asking apple for a better phone whilst it is possible it is hardly a vote winner is it Id love to vote Green but a you cant win so a wasted vote and b you appear to waste precious resources fighting the wrong battles sometimes I think a and b have some overlap Going back to the media coverage question UKIP are set to implode and hopefully will cease to exist soon It would be nice to see the Greens pick up those ex LabourTory voters but youd do well to take a leaf from UKIPs book and focus on a few important big issues rather than being activists for activisms sake,251,6,0.02390438247011952

The Greens simply arent good TV They are politely middle class and uncontroversial Farage is guaranteed to get a reaction  he and in general UKIP policy actively riles people and appeals to a less well informed but far more vocal minority This is also why the Greens dont have a chance at the political big time In this world image counts for a lot more than policy and the most powerful voting block  the working class  arent generally enticed by middle class niceness,83,5,0.060240963855421686

after the last General Election the Green Party complained about the unfairness of the first past the post system claiming that a vote share system would be fairer Here is a TV programme using the vote share rather than the first past the post system to decide who to have on their programme and the Green Party are calling it unfair,61,0,0.0

Those who say the BBC is biased to the left or right are looking at this in the wrong way Its what the BBC DOESNT say or show that is the problem For example take this HuffPo story UKIP were on 25 of all Question Time shows over the last 7 years compared to the Greens 7 For most of that time UKIP didnt have an MP but the Greens did UKIPs and particularly Farages appearances helped to build support for UKIP to the point where they had at one point two MPs and won the 2014 European elections Had the Greens been granted as many opportunities to express their views its arguable that they too could have built more support than they did The Greens were almost excluded from the general election debates and only public pressure got them back in When Natalie Bennett did appear it helped the Greens to just over a million votes in the election the largest vote share theyve ever achieved to date Another example is the Unite for Europe march last Saturday The Met Police estimated 120000 people attended the march people from across the UK and Europe yet the only BBC coverage was a late story buried somewhere on their website and there was no mention on the evening news However the BBC saw fit to extensively cover Douglas Carswell leaving UKIP a move which was obviously and transparently timed by him to take attention away from the protest why else would he resign on that day in particular the day of the march and also the 60th anniversary of the European Community The march was reported well across European media but not by the UKs national broadcaster Youll see a lot of stuff on the BBC and wonder why theyre showing A or B However ask yourself why theyre not showing C How many people wont even know that C exists because the BBC hasnt told them about it An editor at a magazine I used to work for once told me Sometimes the things that people dont say speak louder than the things they do,355,19,0.05352112676056338

Do the money lol The wealth of the west was built on Africas exploitation and youre worried about a few crumbs from the table Beckfords experts estimated Britains debt to Africans in the continent and diaspora to be in the trillions of pounds While this was a useful benchmark its basis was mistaken Not because it was excessive but because the real debt is incalculable For without Africa and its Caribbean plantation extensions the modern world as we know it would not exist Profits from slave trading and from sugar coffee cotton and tobacco are only a small part of the story What mattered was how the pull and push from these industries transformed western Europes economies English banking insurance shipbuilding wool and cotton manufacture copper and iron smelting and the cities of Bristol Liverpool and Glasgow multiplied in response to the direct and indirect stimulus of the slave plantations httpswwwgooglecoukampsamptheguardiancompolitics2005aug20pasthearafrica05,151,7,0.046357615894039736

I think we have to be careful when we say cut out radical Islam I think being radical and being a terrorist are separate things Cutting out radical Islam is interfering in the way someone thinks and that is a freedom we all cherish My suggestion to cutting out radical thought by Muslims is to not alienate them The ugly rhetoric by UKIP has only served to tell some disenfranchised muslim youth that they arent welcome that they are a threat And something like ISIS is looking to those to recruit So my suggestion in doing more is to identify that the division and alienation caused by Farage and his disciples has done more for radical Islam than any moderate or even nonmoderate Muslim has done And the cancer you speak of and need to eradicate is Paul Nuttall and his ilk,142,6,0.04225352112676056
David I think Christopher is trying to challenge your assertion that the vast majority of terrorist atrocities in the last 20 years have been committed by Muslim extremists Its closer to being a little less than half by my reckoning though I admit I was surprised by how large a percentage has been committed by IRA splinter groups and the far right Not to be picky but you seem to have a confused idea of evolution too,77,0,0.0

Jim McMillan  the point you are missing is  the whole of Christianity doesnt feel victimised by Cristian atrocities and the msm dont proclaim Christianity is a religion of peace  Islamist extremists are linked to the religion  wether you agree or not  and the Muslim countries back this up with there human rights atrocities you cant compare this to Cristian countries  as we are truly free and tolerant,67,7,0.1044776119402985

David you seem so sure of this but Im struggling to find statistics that back up what youre saying Could you post a link to what youre citing please Best I could find for a list of total terrorism casualties in the last 20 years was this statistical analysis of deaths due to terrorism worldwide between 2006  2015 Edit just realised you revised your original time period to the last 10 years so actually this is quite apt Also to add that the total deaths in this link between 2006  2015 is around 186 000 Very rough estimate as Im tired httpswwwstatistacomstatistics202871numberoffatalitiesbyterroristattacksworldwide,102,5,0.049019607843137254

Youre really not grasping what Im getting at and perhaps thats me not being clear enough I dont think that Islamic terrorism is not a problem Or for claritys sake without the doublenegative I agree that Islamic terrorism is a problem I dont want to defend people who carry out terrorist actions for any cause For the most part I think were in agreement on these first two points Where we seem to disagree is on the scale of Islamic terrorism From working with Prevent I know that at least in my area Islamic terrorism is as much of a threat as rightwing terrorism Im going to ask again if you can supply any better evidence that the majority of terrorist acts are carried out in the name of Islam I never claimed that what I had was entirely accurate  just what I could dredge up quickly on my way to bed Im well aware that Wikipedia is of questionable accuracy as a source Im merely politely asking that you share the burden of proving your claim,177,12,0.06779661016949153
Im going to go a little further in the hope of finding some common ground I want to explain why given that I dont support or condone Islamic terrorism Im continuing to argue this point It is my firm belief that the more credibility we give to this exaggerated fear of Islamic terrorism the more likely it is to persist into the future Ive two hypotheses for this conclusion 1 Acts of terrorism are carried out to gain political leverage For Islamic terrorism this is to force changes to laws here to more closely resemble that extreme religious way of life as far as I can tell For farright terrorism it is concerned with closing the borders and removing nonwhites from Englands shores If a terrorist act results in mass public fear that causes more political leverage Politicians wont negotiate with terrorists but they will listen to worried voters 2 Backlash against extremist acts results in an us v them mentality This makes further retaliations on both sides much more likely notice my use of the words extremist and terrorist The vast majority of atrocities carried out recently have carried no discernible political message They arent coordinated acts of terrorism with a goal but lone wolf or splinter cell attacks carried out to purely to hurt  for revenge Id guess Id classify them as backlash attacks rather than political terrorism The only way these will reduce is if the sort of people who are likely to commit these acts feel less threatened  and the more airtime we give to the likes of Paul Nuttall Nigel Farage and Katie drown the Syrian toddlers Hopkins the less likely that is to happen,280,10,0.03571428571428571

It is really not necessary to call people names its always a sign of a weak argument when you have to resort to personal insults Why is it so difficult to understand that the best people to identify the wouldbe terrorists are the people amongst whom they live and worship It is so much less Muslimaphobic to want them to sort out their own issues rather than have none Muslims treating them all as wouldbe assassins,76,3,0.039473684210526314

Anne Griffiths I reject your assertion that these issues are their own as you would say These issues are ALL of ours Terrorism didnt begin in a vacuum and the West has played a huge part in making it worse Of course when you talk about identifying Islamic terrorists based in the UK then yes the Muslim community are perhaps the best placed to identify them but that is not going to address the root causes of radicalisation which is the responsibility of us all Nuttalls comment implies that it is simply a matter of making lackadaisical Muslims finally sort it out as though the Muslim community havent time and again publicly condemned violence In reality our political endeavours in the Middle East our proxy wars our propping up of Saudi Arabia and the Israeli occupation have done plenty to make the situation worse Why do we always try to approach everything from a point of view that says you the other must change and do more Real change is something you can only do to yourself you cant impose it on anyone else We each of us need to start with ourselves not look to others to solve our problems,201,5,0.024875621890547265

I came across a useful term recently stochastic terrorism Definition at httpstochasticterrorismblogspotcom  Essentially it acknowledges the well understood idea that at any given time there are a large number of people in the world who given the right stimulus can be induced to do any given thing When its used to make people buy things its called advertising But when pundits or organisations in the full knowledge of this make public inflammatory remarks designed to trigger unknown potentiallyviolent people into violent action it is terrorism We know and if you cant see it after the last few years of news then I cant persuade you of anything that some proportion of people generally vulnerable disturbed people will respond So when ISIS make a video calling for lone wolf attacks this is stochastic terrorism They KNOW that these videos will result in some number of people being triggered into violence And in just the same way the BNP Britain First Katie Hopkins etc KNOW that as a result of their vicious inflammatory and dehumanising bile some number of people will be triggered into violence  racist attacks killings etc Thomas Mair was one such Thats not to say Mair was without blame of course But there was some trigger that caused him to set off with a gun that day apparently Britain First propaganda and the blame must lie there too for the act of stochastic terrorism that their propaganda is,239,8,0.03347280334728033

I dont think i did Pippa you used the colour of someones skin in a negative connotation you actually come across as naive and racist Islamic communities are distinct from a usual community because of their shared beliefs and the rules they live by hence they are much more likely to monitor each others behaviour either consciously or otherwise If this means that certain knowledge of radical tendencies and behaviour is kept quiet to protect that community thats what will happen If you are told your God is the only one that will judge this will affect someones likely hood to adhere to the wider communities standards The same happens with the Catholic confessional Are you keeping up,118,6,0.05084745762711865

One of the reasons I left the green party tbh Aside from the ethical practices of companies like Monsanto theres very little debate to be had on GMOs other than ensuring that the modification is fully investigated However GMOs in and of themselves arent necessarily harmful and theyre something were going to have to inevitably use once climate change fully takes hold,62,6,0.0967741935483871

All GMO are potentially harmful if they stray into the wider eco structure People only ever consider the harm if consumed That is not the entire picture If you have a modified crop that does not respond equally to the natural environmental boosts and stresses spreading unchecked you could have an ecological disaster that can never be entirely eradicated Think of the problems of moving natural plant matter into inappropriate environments eg Japanese knotweed A GMO leak could accelerate climate change faster than fossil fuel waste has A poster here mentioned a plant that tolerates water scarcity as advantage That advantage could see that plant eventually dominate and eradicate all other plant forms Not a clever mistake to make The food supply stresses we have today are artificially maintained by politics and greed economics not the inherent weakness of natural resources,141,3,0.02127659574468085

Daniel the burden of proof is on the believer not on the person making the negative claim As a scientist you ought to know that I studied archaeology and part of that was the human palaeoenvironment including the spread of agriculture We have been modifying crops and cattle for something like 15000 years Crossbreeding selective breeding and artificial selection are all types of GM How on earth is taking a single gene from a cultivar and putting it in another inherently more dangerous than the trial and error and the high failure rate of crossbreeding Besides which you seem to be a firstyear undergrad student not a scientist yet,109,5,0.045871559633027525

As we already produce enough food and everything else to keep everyone healthy and happy the whole GM thing is just about increasing profit for the chemical companies and the exploitation of farmers There should be stronger regulations about food waste at all levels of the foodchain,47,1,0.02127659574468085
