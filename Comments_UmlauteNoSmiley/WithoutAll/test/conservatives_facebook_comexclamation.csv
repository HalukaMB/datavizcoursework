"'PAY AS YOU LEARN A large, independent survey released to say revals that, in England, parents in 1 in 6 state schools are being asked to pay their children\'s school on a regular basis so that school essentials can continue. These essentialsd include textbooks, pens, pencils, art maerials and tickets for such events as plays and concerts. These payments are being used to compensate for the huge gaps in funding that many English state schools are having to bear. Three out of four teachers reported their school\'s budget had been significantly cut this year. The poll also found that 50 percent of teachers had bigger classes than previous years, while many schools were struggling to fill canacies where they could afford the staff. A stunning 93% of teachers at state schools in England described themselves as \'pessimistic\' about their school\'s future. In the recent budget, Philip Hammond sent aside aside for the expansion of government\'s free school programme, with schools free to offer selective education. Theresa May\'s dream is to restore grammar schools to an eminent position in the English educational systems, though these new grammar schools will be highly selective and will take just the cleverest 10% of children. While not supporting the reintroduction of grammar schools in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, the Tory leader, has demanded a \'back to basics\' review of the school curriculum to give it an emphasis on ""knowledge and facts"". Ms Davidson asserts that traditional rote learning - learning facts by heart - will produce better results than a focus on what she calls \'life skills\'. An independent report from the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) has assessed the Scottish government\'s \'Curriculum for Excellence\' as \'a bold and a successful reform that was delivering a broadened education experience for young people within Scotland.\' Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland, has made millions available for headteachers throughout Scotland to use in the ways they themselves decide what is most essential for their schools. Ms Sturgeon has staked her reputation on making significant improvements in the results obtained by pupils and students at Scottish schools. The Sage of Auchtermuchty will periodically report on their progress.'",360,0,0.0

"""Back in 1973, we were told we were joining a 'common market.' What we actually joined was a supranational political union. Since that ill-fated Yes vote, we have seen our rights of self-government slowly eroded in the stealth creation of a United States of Europe, which has its own flag, national anthem, parliament, central bank, court of justice, and a vast civil service. The EU already holds a huge amount of control over our financial services, fishing, farming, energy and trade. It dictates UK business and employment legislation and immigration rules. It seeks greater control over our law enforcement services, our foreign affairs and tax policy. There is significant momentum behind plans for an EU-wide army and police force - we only have to read the EU's Five Presidents report to see their ambitions lie in further advancement towards a political superstate. In addition to this we send million each week to Brussels for the privilege, that's money that could be better spent on our priorities. One critical area where we have lost control - immigration - is was at the forefront of a lot of people's minds as we approach the referendum in June. I am in favour of immigration. But let's be clear - what most people want is a fair and controlled immigration system, one where we have the final say. But in the EU, we don't. EU law demands that the UK has an open door to EU countries, which has resulted in a population the size of Newcastle arriving every year. It doesn't take a genius to realise that this is unsustainable. Not only has this put a great strain on school places and on public services like the NHS, it has also forced us to prevent people with much-needed skills from coming to Britain. It means we have to turn away doctors, teachers, bright fee-paying students and entrepreneurs from our friends in the Commonwealth and beyond. This is clearly unfair. We have lost control of our borders. The only way to install a fair and manageable immigration system is to leave the EU single market.""",351,0,0.0

"""Back in 1973, we were told we were joining a 'common market.' What we actually joined was a supranational political union. Since that ill-fated Yes vote, we have seen our rights of self-government slowly eroded in the stealth creation of a United States of Europe, which has its own flag, national anthem, parliament, central bank, court of justice, and a vast civil service. The EU already holds a huge amount of control over our financial services, fishing, farming, energy and trade. It dictates UK business and employment legislation and immigration rules. It seeks greater control over our law enforcement services, our foreign affairs and tax policy. There is significant momentum behind plans for an EU-wide army and police force - we only have to read the EU's Five Presidents report to see their ambitions lie in further advancement towards a political superstate. In addition to this we send million each week to Brussels for the privilege, that's money that could be better spent on our priorities. One critical area where we have lost control - immigration - is was at the forefront of a lot of people's minds as we approach the referendum in June. I am in favour of immigration. But let's be clear - what most people want is a fair and controlled immigration system, one where we have the final say. But in the EU, we don't. EU law demands that the UK has an open door to EU countries, which has resulted in a population the size of Newcastle arriving every year. It doesn't take a genius to realise that this is unsustainable. Not only has this put a great strain on school places and on public services like the NHS, it has also forced us to prevent people with much-needed skills from coming to Britain. It means we have to turn away doctors, teachers, bright fee-paying students and entrepreneurs from our friends in the Commonwealth and beyond. This is clearly unfair. We have lost control of our borders. The only way to install a fair and manageable immigration system is to leave the EU single market.""",351,0,0.0

"'PAY AS YOU LEARN A large, independent survey released to say revals that, in England, parents in 1 in 6 state schools are being asked to pay their children\'s school on a regular basis so that school essentials can continue. These essentialsd include textbooks, pens, pencils, art maerials and tickets for such events as plays and concerts. These payments are being used to compensate for the huge gaps in funding that many English state schools are having to bear. Three out of four teachers reported their school\'s budget had been significantly cut this year. The poll also found that 50 percent of teachers had bigger classes than previous years, while many schools were struggling to fill canacies where they could afford the staff. A stunning 93% of teachers at state schools in England described themselves as \'pessimistic\' about their school\'s future. In the recent budget, Philip Hammond sent aside aside for the expansion of government\'s free school programme, with schools free to offer selective education. Theresa May\'s dream is to restore grammar schools to an eminent position in the English educational systems, though these new grammar schools will be highly selective and will take just the cleverest 10% of children. While not supporting the reintroduction of grammar schools in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, the Tory leader, has demanded a \'back to basics\' review of the school curriculum to give it an emphasis on ""knowledge and facts"". Ms Davidson asserts that traditional rote learning - learning facts by heart - will produce better results than a focus on what she calls \'life skills\'. An independent report from the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) has assessed the Scottish government\'s \'Curriculum for Excellence\' as \'a bold and a successful reform that was delivering a broadened education experience for young people within Scotland.\' Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland, has made millions available for headteachers throughout Scotland to use in the ways they themselves decide what is most essential for their schools. Ms Sturgeon has staked her reputation on making significant improvements in the results obtained by pupils and students at Scottish schools.

"'As the Prime Minister signed the letter triggering Article 50 the ""divorce clause"" in the EU treaties that provides the only legal route for the UK to withdraw from the EU we reached the end of the beginning. For nine months the UK and the EU have been in limbo. In the days and weeks following the June 2016 referendum, those who advocated leaving the EU were quick to claim that the much-heralded economic disasters threatened by George Osborne and David Cameron in ""Project Fear"" had not occurred. Unhappy Remainers were equally swift in their rebuttals, as proponents of the two camps seemed determined to replay the arguments of their respective referendum campaigns and in some cases the arguments of more than four decades. Certainly, while the value of sterling might have dropped and inflation begun to rise, the economic indicators are far from the nightmare scenarios invoked during the referendum. But that scenario was based on the idea that Cameron would trigger Article 50 immediately upon a Leave vote; in practice, he left the field, and his successor delayed the fateful act. These last nine months have thus been little more than a phoney war. The UK has barely begun to outline its negotiating objectives, while the other 27 member states made clear they would not engage in discussions before the UK formally indicated its intention to leave the Union. That day has now come. The nature of the UK\'s future relationship with the EU remains unclear, although the Prime Minister\'s construal of the vote to leave the EU as a sign of popular support for curbing immigration has led to one clear red line: that the UK will not seek to remain in the single market. This decision is perfectly rational and logical if one accepts the Prime Minister\'s premise regarding the reasons 17 million people voted to leave, since free movement of people is a prerequisite of membership of the single market. Yet, there is good cause to believe Mrs May is misguided in her interpretation: there were myriad reasons for the leave votes, whether to reclaim sovereignty or reduce payments to the EU, all neatly encapsulated in the beguiling phrase ""take back control"". For many of those who voted leave, immigration and free movement were not the reason to seek EU withdrawal; even many Leavers acknowledge the importance of EU nationals to the UK economy. To base a decision to leave the single market on the premise that we shall thereby ""control"" immigration is only a plausible thesis if those advocating it believe that Leave voters intended to prioritise controlling immigration numbers over the security of the economy, our agriculture and our welfare services, including the NHS and care of the elderly of which are heavily dependent upon immigrant labour. Nonetheless, the Prime Minister appears to have adopted an approach that endears her to the hard Brexiteers in her own party, allowing a clean break from the EU, even if a majority in the country seems to favour a closer ongoing relationship with the 27. For a city such as Cambridge, and for the University of Cambridge especially, membership of the single market with its associated rights of free movement is self-evidently beneficial. Many academics, myself included, have benefited over the years from EU funding but what is at least as important is the opportunity to collaborate across borders, without having to consider whether a visa is needed. EU nationals from other countries have played a vital role as students and colleagues. Even Brexiteers who wanted to reduce immigration were broadly in favour of guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals who were already in the UK at the time of the referendum. Alongside many of us who would have preferred the UK not to be in the EU\'s departure lounge, some of those Leavers have been demanding that the Government should give a unilateral undertaking to EU nationals already in the UK. The Government has said such people, along with UK nationals resident elsewhere in the EU, will be their first priority in the negotiations. This is laudable, although it fails to comprehend a key facet of EU negotiations: nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. The campaign to secure the rights of EU nationals will no doubt continue in the hope that some of the uncertainty engendered by the process of Brexit can be minimised, though the idea that some issues can be picked off and resolved in tranches is almost certainly fanciful. Meanwhile, the withdrawal negotiations are likely to take the two years envisaged in the Lisbon Treaty and that will only resolve the divorce settlement. For the longer term future arrangements with the 27, further, more protracted negotiations are likely. Triggering Article 50 is not the end, though it would seem to herald the beginning of the end of the UK\'s membership of the EU.'",812,0,0.0

"'James Egan All I can say is that there was a very good reason for joining the 6. However that reason has gone and most of us do not want to subsidise 25 out of the 27. Just study the political history from the post war trade union strikes right up to and including the late seventies.in the fifties and sixties there were so many strikes that overseas customers never knew when or if their order would be delivered. The value of the pound plummeted because of the continuing rounds of pay rises thought to stop the strikes but actually fuelling more. When it had got so bad that the rest of the world stopped buying British we had to join the 6 to have any market at all. Since the late seventies the UK has reduced the number of petty strikes and has become much more in-line with the values of western countries. In order to build from our present position we need to stop the restrictions on all forms of farming and to re-grow our almost non existent manufacturing industry. At one time 90% of our GDP was from manufactured goods to less than 10% now. It is logical and reasonable that the Blue party will be most suitable to lead this as the Reds only want to empty the bank accounts and the others are like the wind changing at a moments notice and promising things that they will never deliver. Once there is manufacturing growth it is likely that the north of the country, including Scotland, will be the areas seeing the most improvements and employment rises. Hopefully when this occurs the current Scottish cancer (SNP) will go back to the little hole in the Lothian district from whence they came. So it is onwards and upwards for the UK and the Blue team seem to be the best ones to oversee it. Re-think your plan to quit, but do read the political history from post WW2 to now, as you will soon remember why you have been a blue boy,like me. Good luck in your research.'",351,0,0.0

"""And also, 200 boxes of British-made ammunition and weapons were intercepted en route to the former al Qaeda group in Damascus just over two weeks ago. They are now in a new umbrella group, Hay'at Tahrir al Sham, with four allied terror groups. ISIS has also been operating against the Syrian Government in the Damascus area. The previous week the Government had stated they would continue supporting the Syrian 'moderate opposition', which is of course illegal action anyway, but then stated they could not name the 'moderate opposition' groups. Which is because the Government has been supporting terrorism for five years in Syria. In January last year under Liaison Committee questioning, Cameron admitted the 70,000 'moderate rebels' he supported were in reality 'hardline Islamists'. In May 2015, a terrorism trial for offences in Syria collapsed in London when the Defence pointed out the Government supports the same groups the Defendant was involved with, and it was considered too embarassing for the Government for the trial to continue. US Defence Intelligence Report 2012 'The Salafist, the Muslim Brotherhood and AQI are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria'. An insurgency our Government and the US fully supported. Also in that Report: 'There is a possibility of establishing a Salafist principality in eastern Syria, and that is what supporters to the opposition in Syria want, to isolate the Syrian regime'. This is a reference to ISIS, the 'JV team' as Obama referred to them. Comment I wrote on windbag Johnson's FB yesterday:- 'Boris Johnson, it is unbelievably shameful that Matthew Rycroft objected to OPCW-UN inspectors going into Iraq to investigate chemical weapons use by ISIS. And I just caught up with this news; so unanimous concern of the UN Security Council about ISIS use of chemical weapons - which they have done extensively in Syria - followed by our Government trying to block investigation of their use of chemical weapons in Iraq? How really diabolically shameful. I am waiting for a reply to mid- January correspondence I wrote to A Rudd which must have been lost after the Home Office received it as they say they didn't but I received an auto acknowledgement. And in any case had sent copies to Ms Rudd at her Parliamentary Office on 27th February and received an auto acknowledgement to that as well. This concerned the statement on leaked tape by J Kerry at a UN side meeting, to the Syrian opposition saying that the US wanted ISIS to remain free to put pressure on President Assad, but that Russia was bombing ISIS. This was at a time that the US was pretending to lead an international coalition against ISIS. Kerry was due to visit here and I was just pointing out he should be barred as a threat to our national security, due to his protection of ISIS. I had made the same point about Obama last year when he was due to visit, he had blocked 75% of US sorties from bombing ISIS in Iraq, leaving them free to murder thousands more Iraqis. I didn't receive a reply to that email at all The polite little auto response in January stated the Home Office aims to reply to correspondence within 20 days. It is now about two and a half months since I received that so I expect a reply from them soon What was the point of writing that here - umm??? Oh yes I remember, our Government disgracefully trying to block investigation into ISIS use of chemical weapons in Iraq.

"'SAFE IN TORY HANDS Today (April 1st - but this is not an April Fool\'s joke), Biffo Johnson, the blundering buffoon of a Foreign Secretary, declared: ""As ever, the UK remains implacable and ROCK-LIKE in our support for Gibraltar."" Why is that even when Johnson intends to be serious, he sounds silly? This reassurance was necessary because Theresa May did mention Gibraltar once in her 2,200-word letter triggering Article 50, starting the Brexit process. Did she even forget to let Girbralter now she was triggering Article 50 in the way she forgot to tell Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? The increasing levels of incompetence in the Tory Brexiteers is not reassuring. Are the interests of these \'mini-fish\' an ""afterthought"", as the chairman of the House of Lords EU Committee warned? Clare Moody, Labour MEP for Gibraltar and south west England, told BBC Radio Four\'s Today programme ""If the government has overlooked the interests of Gibraltar, which is a crucial part of the kind of constitutional arrangements of our membership of the European Union, then what else are they going to overlook as well?"" Theresa May has certainly declared that she intends to ignore the UK\'s constitutional arrangements with Scotland by booting the Scottish Parliament\'s request for a second idy reference, if required after the Brexit terms are clear, as far and deep into the long grass as she can. From beyond the border, Scots can still hear Mother Theresa crowing on the Tory dungheap. And are these the same thigh-high boots she wore to meet the Queen? Is TWO-FACED too strong a term? Let\'s ask prison staff in England and Wales? Only a few days ago, Justice Secretary Liz Truss was strumpeting from the dung heap that prison staff in England and Wales will receive new pay allowances of up to ,000! Hurrah! But hold on. It turns out that only Only 5% of existing prison staff will receive increased allowances while the other 95% will receive..... You do the maths. Only 1,617 prison officers out of more than 30,742 staff working in public-sector prisons - 5.26% of the workforce - will receive any kind of additional allowance. Mother Theresa has assured the nation that \'the NHS is safe in our hands\'. What else can she assure us is safe in Tory hands?'",383,2,0.005221932114882507

And I\'m absolutely clear that our current woman Prime Minister will show the same resolve in relation to Gibralter as her predecessor."" Although Mrs May has denied that she is a ""second Mrs Thatcher"", Lord Howard, who is at the heart of the Brexiteer, clearly beleives that she is willing to take whatever steps is necessary to keep Gibralter under the sole authority of the United Kingdom. Mrs May has already made it absolutely clear the UK is ""steadfastly committed"" to Gibraltar. Even if the government of Gibralter were to request negotiations concerning the current constitutional arrangements, Mrs May would declare ""now is not the time"", exactly as she has done with Scotland. While it is inconceivable that one member of the European Union would send a task force against another member of the European Union, Lord Howard seems to be suggesting that there would be no such restraints since the United Kingdom triggered Article 50. It is irrelevant that 95.9% of the voters in Gibralter voted to REMAIN a member of the European Union. Labour\'s deputy leader Tom Watson has questioned how ""senior Tories raising the prospect of war in Europe"" would help the UK\'s Brexit negotiations. Given that there are more than three-quarters of a million Brits living in Spain, it would be helpful if Mrs May ruled out any form of gunboat dimplomacy in relation to Spain - or to Scotland.'",309,0,0.0

However, as we make these cutbacks we need a cost effective transition. It seems only common sense that if the government bodies are going to reduce and close which currently support the members of our society who need support, that from the midst of those communities organisations will spring up to take the weight of these closures and cutbacks. If this is the case as expected, then the cost of re-establishing said organisations would be extremely high and waste a large portion of the funds raised to undertake this new responsibility. The transition I propose would be a transition of the already established organisations back to the public sector, rather than simply closing down these established services only to have the charity sector then have to open a brand new infrastructure to replace these government run organisations. It seems only logical to hand over what is already in place rather than to close one at a high cost and open another in its place at a high cost rather than the administration required to simply pass on the baton.

"""sadly today I have cancelled my membership and support of the Conservative Party. I have supported the Tories since 1979, but no longer feel that this party matches my values and principles. This has not been an easy decision, but progressively I have become disenchanted with the current govt and leadership in spite of early high expectations. I have believed in the Tory principles of a fairer Britain, a country that delivers opportunity for all, and rewards hard work and effort. I now see a party being dragged ever increasingly to the right, by a group of all too powerful back benchers. I see a govt that have abandoned the 48% who voted to Remain, as we hurtle ever closer to a Hard Brexit. I see a chancellor who is impotent, even when making small and reasonable fiscal changes. On question time I see an arrogance, ignorance and breathtaking naivety from David Davis when it comes to negotiations with the EU, and yesterday we hear an ex leader and Home Secretary threatening war against out allies and neighbours. Luke, I really do not recognise this party, from the one I voted and campaigned for in 2015. To me it feels that we have not moved to exploit the centre ground vacated by a pathetic Labour party or chaotic Liberal party, but instead have replaced UKIP, with barmy expectations, right wing rhetoric and delivery of a disastrous deal with Europe, ie, probably no deal, to please the likes of Gove, Fox, Davis, Redmond and his gang. Currently I see no 'home' for my support, and only hope for an early general election to increase the Conservative majority and reduce the power of the back benchers ans make the Tories more balanced and palatable. It seems however that May will not go to the country and gain a mandate for her perilous course. I only hope over time, greater pragmatism, openness, and compromise will take place to ensure the future for our country and children. What we need now is a centrist party that delivers on Brexit in respect of the referendum, but also takes into consideration the whole population, not least the most vulnerable who will suffer the most from a hard Brexit. Failure to do so, could lead to a catastrophic exit from the EU, followed by a general election win for the labour left!! I hope that you and other Tories, can start to influence the PM, but to date many more moderate members appear 'silenced', as to speak against a hard Brexit, appears to be undemocratic and virtually treasonable. Having knocked many doors during the last election and during the referendum I would imagine a Hard Brexit could be v damaging to the Tories in many parts of the South West, as well as S Glos. I have no axe to grind with the local MP Luke Hall, but am really concerned by this govt and PM who forge ahead without a real mandate""",496,2,0.004032258064516129

"'How plan for \'cheap win\' over Gibraltar backfired on No 10 (Source: The Times Online 4/4/17) Downing Street intended to hand Spain a ""cheap win"" over Gibraltar at the start of Brexit talks but miscalculated the scale of the domestic backlash, senior officials claimed yesterday. Olly Robbins, Theresa May\'s chief Brexit negotiator, is said to have been instrumental in ensuring that the Rock was not explicitly mentioned in her letter triggering Article 50 last week. The Department for Exiting the EU\'s permanent secretary, backed by senior figures in No 10, is said to have anticipated that Gibraltar would be included in the EU\'s draft response but argued that it was strategically preferable that Spain made the first move. ""They wanted to give Spain a cheap win. What they didn\'t account for was that Gibraltar is one of those issues that can go off like a rocket,"" a well-placed figure at the heart of Brexit negotiations said. However, a government source said: ""Our commitment to Gibraltar is clear and we do not recognise this account."" Mrs May moved to calm down the rhetoric after Lord Howard of Lympne, one of her predecessors as Tory leader, suggested on Sunday that she would be ready to go to war to protect Gibraltar\'s interests. Asked during a visit to Jordan whether she could rule out war with Spain, Mrs May evoked Churchill\'s dictum that it was always ""better to jaw-jaw than war-war"". ""What we are doing with all European countries in the European Union is sitting down and talking to them,"" she said. ""We are going to be talking to them about getting the best possible deal for the United Kingdom and for those countries, Spain included. It\'s definitely jaw-jaw."" Senior government sources insisted that Lord Howard had not been asked to make his intervention, in which he said he was sure that Mrs May would show the same resolve as Margaret Thatcher had in the military campaign to recapture the Falklands in 1982. A No 10 spokesman said that the deployment of a Falklands-style task force ""isn\'t going to happen"", adding: ""All that Lord Howard was trying to establish is the resolve that we will have to protect the rights of Gibraltar and its sovereignty."" Mrs May said: ""Our position on Gibraltar has not changed. We will be working with them as part of our negotiations to ensure that we get the best possible trade deal for the United Kingdom and the best possible deal for Gibraltar."" Alfonso Dastis, the Spanish foreign minister, said in response to Lord Howard\'s comments: ""The Spanish government is a little surprised by the tone of comments regarding Gibraltar coming out of Britain, which is a country known for its composure."" After two days of confusion, Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar\'s chief minister, appeared to have caught up with Downing Street\'s original intention as he sought to put the best gloss on the affair. He said that it was ""very helpful of Spain to have put this front and centre this early on in the process"". Some observers had expected an intervention by the Spanish at the final moments to throw a spanner in the works. ""I think Spain has made a huge error of judgment not just in putting this early on, but in effect denying their own citizens the application of that deal if they work in Gibraltar going forward,"" said Mr Picardo. Mr Dastis met David Davis, the Brexit secretary, for talks yesterday at the start of a planned two-day visit to Spain and Portugal. Downing Street characterised the discussions as ""very friendly and very constructive"", adding that Mr Davis agreed that Britain would be ""steadfast in our support for Gibraltar"". Boris Johnson will also seek to calm tensions at a meeting with Sigmar Gabriel, the German foreign minister, in London today. The foreign secretary will urge both sides to avoid references to divorce and say that the issue of security will not be used as a ""bargaining chip"" but neither should Gibraltar, aides said.'",668,0,0.0

Following the position that the European Parliament has taken, supported by the majority of MEPs, including the UK Labour Party's MEPs (against the interests of the UK), I feel the need to make the following legal points and put my position on what is the way forward and what red lines we should have. The position the EU is taking is illegal under international treaty law. Their position breaches: The UN Charter 1945 - Articles 1-1, 1-2, 2-3, 2-4 and 74 The Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties 1969 - Articles 46-2, 60-3(b), 70(a), 71-1(a-b) and 71-2(a-b) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1976 - Article 1-1 The Treaty of Lisbon 2007 - Article 8. As such, it is clear that the UK is not going to get any deal that is not punitive nor one that it is legally entitled to if we continue through the Article 50 negotiation route. As such, we should terminate all negotiations, repeal the European Communities Act 1972, temporarily go the WTO route (more painful for the EU than UK) and deal with any future trade deal with the EU as an independent, sovereign nation as equals. Further to this, we should launch an action within the UN against the EU for it's illegal position taken during these negotiations. Red lines for the UK should be as follows: 1. No subservience to any European Court and removing ourselves from any treaty that puts us under the jurisdiction of such courts. 2. Full control of our migration policy with EU citizens treated exactly like non-EU citizens. Those already legally resident will permitted to remain in line with international law. If the EU refuses to extend this to British citizens, the UK government will act in their interests by taking the EU to the International Court for their breach of international law in this regard. 3. Full control over the Exclusive Economic Zone. No guaranteed fishing rights kept by EU fishing fleets. All fish caught in EEZ must be landed at UK docks. 4. Gibraltar and Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus remain British. There will be no special arrangements on borders for these areas. 5. In relation to Northern Ireland, the soft border will remain so long as Ireland keeps to it's common travel area commitments in relation to defence of the UK border. The UK is at liberty to make this a hard border if it is abused. 6. The UK government will seek to continue it's involvement in pan-European agreements that are separate to EU membership, ie non-EU/EEA member states are also members. This includes both Euratom and Erasmus. 7. The CFP and CAP will no longer have any status in the UK. CAP payments will continue in the short-term paid for by the UK Government until an alternate provision is established. 8. EU pensions of UK citizens will be met by the UK government if the EU refuses to meet them itself. However, in that eventuality, the UK will demand proportional access to the EU pension fund to cover the prior commitments made by the EU. 9. No exit payment will be made by the UK. The UK has already paid more than it's fair share and any commitments that the EU believes that the UK owes it, may be taken from the NET contribution already made by the UK Government.""",590,0,0.0

"'BENEFITS bosses axed a disabled woman\'s Motability car to save cash but then agreed to pay out ,000 to taxi her to and from work. The bureaucrats first decided Jan Davis, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, no longer qualified for the disability allowance she used to pay for the car. But just weeks later officers from the same Government department ruled she did qualify for help in getting to work. They agreed to pay for a taxi to take Jan, from Ayr, to and from her job in East Kilbride, 33 miles away. The move, which would cost the taxpayer an extra ,000 a year, was last night branded ""shambolic"" by her local MP. Jan, 58, who suffers excruciating pain, had been receiving the Personal Independence Payment, a non-means tested benefit, and used this money to lease a Motability car. But the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) last month informed Jan she would no longer qualify after a snap reassessment of her benefits ruled she did not need the car to live independently. Desperate to keep her job at HM Revenue & Customs, Jan turned to the DWP\'s Access to Work scheme after taking advice from her MP. To her surprise, she was informed the DWP would pay for her to take a taxi to and from work despite a cost of almost ,000 over three years, compared with the cost of leasing a car over that period. Last night, Jan, of Ayr, blasted the DWP\'s approach, saying: ""It\'s crazy it would have cost them less than for me to keep the car and yet they are willing to pay up to ,000 for taxis. ""If you are a disabled person living on benefits, your needs are ignored. ""I\'m doing my best to continue working but I feel as though this Government just does not care."" https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/ms-sufferer-slams-awful-benefits-chiefs-who-axed-her-motability-car-in-favour-of-taxis/'",308,0,0.0

Failures in the administration of benefits meant that the numbers in default were already on the increase before 2013 but the problem has escalated after the removal of national council tax benefit which in theory at least protected low-income adults. In its place, following the Local Government Finance Act 2012, more than 300 local support schemes now operate, varying in detail between authorities, and which may require all adults of working age to pay anything from zero to 45 per cent of the annual council tax, even if unemployed or receiving means-tested welfare. Yet at the same time, these same adults are the ones who have seen their benefits cut as a result of the housing benefit caps, the overall benefit cap, the bedroom tax and sanctions on Jobseeker\'s Allowance, or their wages frozen. For them, council tax is now less a system of local taxation but rather a mechanism for creating debt."" http://www.bigissue.com/news/great-british-council-tax-scandal-big-issue-investigation/'",185,0,0.0

After almost every unpleasant incident, anywhere in UK, these four words are trotted out, and we all settle back into our armchairs, reassured. But, like almost everything else spouted by UK media and UK politicians, those four words are a blatant lie! Lessons are not learned. If they had been, we wouldn\'t have yet another heartbroken Police Widow! We wouldn\'t have more death on the street. We wouldn\'t be rushing to appease the guilty and suppress all criticism. Appeasement never works. You cannot appease a bully. Bullies scent weakness and keep pushing. Ask Neville Chaimberlain, who returned from a meeting with Hitler triumphantly waving his piece of paper. Millions died! We didn\'t learn that lesson. We never learn lessons. We British just stagger from crisis to disaster and back again. We have done so throughout history. We are never ready, always believing \'it\' won\'t happen. We always cut expenditure on defence and law enforcement, until we are backed into a corner and fighting for our lives. Somehow, we survive, no thanks to our so called leaders. But now we are facing a different foe, unlike anything we have ever faced before. Insidious, clever, secretive. Already well embedded into our society in positions of power and influence. Settled into every day life. And the home grown terrorists keep attacking. MI5 has admitted publicly that they are dealing with over 400 threats inside UK alone. They said it last night. And that\'s just the one\'s they admit to, or know about. We, as a nation and as a culture, are under attack from within, and we are in denial. So much in denial that we send an unarmed policeman to guard the very centre of our nation. He is now dead. His wife a widow, his children fatherless. Alone this brave man faced a fanatic with a knife, and he died. so no, politician, don\'t lie to me. Lessons have NOT been learned. The ropes and sails on Nelson\'s ships were rotten when he faced his enemy at Trafalgar. The Duke of Wellington had almost no heavy weapons to use at Waterloo. In both World Wars the British forces were under resourced and the politicians didn\'t believe war would come. And now, today, we send an unarmed policeman to guard the most sensitive establishment in Britain. It beggars belief. We, as a nation, rely on unarmed hero\'s. No hero should be unarmed, or alone when he faces an enemy. Lesson\'s have Not been learned by politicians. But the most important lesson, who the British people vote for, is in the voter\'s hands.

"""So fecking true ....is this .. they are all.on the telly with their usual fluffy remarks ...... Welcome to London: We can say we're not afraid, light candles and make hearts of our hands but the truth is that we can't go on like this (Daily Mail yes it may be the Mail but its fecking bang on ) They stood in the centre of Brussels. Row on row. Hands held high, making hearts to the heavens. Showing the slaughtered they were not forgotten. Reminding themselves they were here with love. Looking to show humanity wins. That love conquers all. They lay in the centre of London, face down where they fell. Stabbed by a knife, rammed with a car, flung, broken, into the Thames, life bleeding out on the curb. And the news came thick and fast. An injured woman is assisted after a man drove a 4x4 into pedestrians along Westminster Bridge on Wednesday afternoon An injured woman is assisted after a man drove a 4x4 into pedestrians along Westminster Bridge on Wednesday afternoon A car rammed deliberately into pedestrians on the bridge. Ten innocents down. A police officer stabbed at the House of Commons. Confirmed dead. Another woman now, dead at the scene. Shots fired. An Asian man rushed to hospital. People make hearts with their hands during a ceremony in Belgium to commemorate the first anniversary of the bomb attacks in Brussels A woman, plucked from the water. And I grew colder. And more tiny. No anger for me this time. No rage like I've felt before. No desperate urge to get out there and scream at the idiots who refused to see this coming. Not even a nod for the glib idiots who say this will not defeat us, that we will never be broken, that cowardice and terror will not get the better of Britain. Because, as loyal as I am, as patriotic as I am, as much as my whole younger life was about joining the British military and fighting for my country I fear we are broken. Not because of this ghoulish spectacle outside our own Parliament. Not because of the lives rammed apart on the pavement, even as they thought about what was for tea. Or what train home they might make. But because this is us now. This is our country now. This is what we have become. To this, we have been reduced. Because all the while those forgiving fools in Brussels stood with their stupid hands raised in hearts to the sky, another mischief was in the making. More death was in the pipeline. As the last life-blood of a police officer ran out across the cobbles, the attacker was being stretchered away in an attempt to save his life. London is a city so desperate to be seen as tolerant, no news of the injured was released. No clue about who was safe or not. Liberals convince themselves multiculturalism works because we all die together, too. An entire city of monkeys: see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. Blind. Deaf. And dumb. Immersed in a seething pit of hatred, hidden in pockets of communities plagued by old animosities and ancient strife. These people may have left their lands. But they have brought every tension, every conflict, every bit of fight here with them. The Afghans hate the Somalis who loathe the Eritreans. As it was before, it is now. London is a city of ghettos behind a thin veneer of civility kept polished by a Muslim mayor whose greatest validation is his father's old job. Son-of-a-bus-driver Sadiq. I see him now, penning a missive about how London is a beautiful and tolerant city, how we are united by shared values and understanding, and how we will not be cowed by terror. Sure enough, there he was, saying exactly that, just now. Fool. Even as mothers text to check their children are safe. Including my own, worrying about me as I sit overlooking the scene, feeling fearful of this place where monsters lurk and steal lives away in an instant. For nothing. I would ask Sadiq to stop talking. Empty words. Meanwhile, banning pictures of women in bikinis on the Underground. How does that help? Please, no hashtag, no vigil, no tea lights. I am begging you not to light up Parliament in the colours of the Union. Because we are not united. We are wrenched asunder. The patriots of the rest of England versus the liberals in this city. The endless tolerance to those who harm us, (while the Home Office tries to shift the focus of public fear to white terror) versus the millions like me who face the truth, with worried families and hopeless hearts, who feel the country sinking. We are taken under the cold water by this heavy right foot in the south, a city of lead, so desperately wedded to the multicultural illusion that it can only fight those who love the country the most, blame those who are most proud to be British, and shout racist at the 52%. This place is just like Sweden. Terrified of admitting the truth about the threat we face, about the horrors committed by the migrants we failed to deter because to admit that we are sinking, and fast, would be to admit that everything the liberals believe is wrong. That multiculturalism has not worked. That it is one big fat failure and one big fat lie. President Erdogan of Turkey said there is a war being waged between the crescent and the cross. But he is wrong. Because the cross is not strong. We are down on bended knee, a doormat to be trodden on, a joke only funny to those that wish us harm. The war is between London and the rest of the country. Between the liberals and the right-minded. Between those who think it is more important to tip-toe around the cultures of those who choose to join us, rather than defend our own culture. How many more times? And how many more attacks must pass before we acknowledge these are no longer the acts of 'extremists'? That there is no safe badge with which to hold these people at arm's length, in the way the liberals casually use the term 'far-right' for anyone who has National pride. These events are no longer extreme. They are commonplace. Every day occurrences. These people are no longer extremists. They are simply more devout. More true to their beliefs. Beliefs which will be supported endlessly across our state broadcaster for the next few months until we buy into the narrative that one religion is not to blame. That in fact we should blame Brexit supporters. For believing in a Britain. As it was before. Anything but the truth. This is why there is no anger from me this time, no rage. No nod for those who pretend we will not be cowed, even as they rush home to text their mum they are safe. No surprise that the city of which I was so proud is now punctured by fear, and demarcated even more formally by places we cannot tread; there were always parts in which a white woman could not safely walk. Now I feel only sadness, overwhelming sadness. I will walk over the river tonight and look to the Thames, to the Union flag lowered at half mast, and the Parliament below, and I will wonder, just how much longer we can go on like this.""",1256,0,0.0

"'I suppose we cannot continue bashing the Conservative for their total incompetence of running the country. Lets look at what has gone wrong with Jeromy Corbyn\'s leadership of the Labour party in making it the party of jokers and laughs. Well let\'s look at it this way, being such a weak leader, he is not totally to blame. There are a mixture of factors. Some of these are beyond his control. The existence of media hostility. Attacking left wing politicians is what large sections of the media is for, and anyone who is on the left needs to recognize that. You could do absolutely everything right, and they would still come after you. Ideological fissures within the PLP. These have always existed and always will. Brexit being an incredibly difficult issue for the Labour Party. This was always going to be the case. If you come out full throated one way or the other, you annoy a large section of your base. Now, you will note that these things are not binary - they exist on a continuum and good leaders are able to navigate around them and minimise the damage that they can do. As an easy example, you counter the existence of a hostile media by not making any dumb mistakes that can be pounced upon by the media, and having a really disciplined operation. And you silence critical members of the PLP by being able to woo them with potential office, stressing the realistic possibility of Labour government. Witness how under New Labour the more left-wing factions either shut up or were effectively sidelined. Corbyn\'s particular responses to those problems have not made it possible to minimise these problems. Rather, they\'ve been to exacerbate them. It\'s been gaffe after gaffe. Pointless own goal after own goal. So the media (and the Tories) jump on it. Nobody in the critical sections of the PLP thinks Labour has a chance next election, so Corbyn simply has no effective power of patronage. Don\'t criticise - you might be a minister in the Labour government of 2020 that will never happen! Not a very effective message. This crystalises as more and more members of the PLP becoming openly hostile to Corbyn. At the start of his tenure, it was only the most vocal members on the right of the party (eg. Chuka Umunna and Simon Danzcuk, both of whom I was critical of on Quora at the time). But by the time of the leadership challenge and no-confidence motion, it was 80% of the PLP. It wasn\'t just the usual suspects. This does not happen under competent leadership. Moving past that, the fundamental thing that has gone wrong for Corbyn is that he and his team have been defined as a ""threat to national security, economic security and my family\'s security"". That\'s not my turn of phrase. It\'s from a mailshot that was sent to me by the Tories immediately after Jeremy Corbyn was initially elected Labour leader. I suppose many have had a good chuckle at that, thinking it was hyperbolic guff and that it was far too extreme for the Tories to make stick. After all, Corbyn was basically a cuddly grandad figure (albeit a cuddly grandad who has some unsavory associations). But it has stuck. And it\'s stuck because Corbyn has repeatedly fallen into obvious national security traps. Here\'s a sampling of Labour idiotics:- Saying you would never ever drop a nuclear weapon, even if your party decided to keep them Shadow Chancellor and close Corbyn ally John McDonnell quoting Chairman Mao, a guy most famous for causing the deaths of sixty million people, in the House of Commons. What\'s more, doing this when a sizable chunk of the electorate think you are an unreconstructed communist. Pro-tip: if people think you are a communist, try and distance yourself from actually existing communists! Questioning shoot to kill in the immediate aftermath of the Paris attacks. There are legitimate concerns over shoot to kill. But wait until the blood is dry before talking about them. People want to feel safe Insinuating that it is NATO that is primarily at fault after Russia has literally just invaded a sovereign country, and be generally sceptical about NATO Saying that you might have nuclear missile submarines but without the nuclear missiles Saying that Bin Laden should have been arrested, and that his death was a tragedy Saying that we need to have a ""discussion"" with Argentina over the Falklands. No, we don\'t. They are British, so long as the Islanders wish to remain British. Which they do. By overwhelming majority (near unanimity). There is nothing to discuss, in light of these facts All of which, when taken as a set, make you a joke on national security for everyone who isn\'t already a paid up Corbynista. Both Labour voters (especially the sort that now have left and joined UKIP ) and Tory voters care a lot about this sort of thing. Unless you are minimally competent on national security, you can\'t talk past your base. And Corbyn\'s base simply isn\'t big enough to win a general election. Just as a rule for us at UKIP who aspire to high office is ""never ever say you want to privatise the NHS"", a rule of Labour politicians who aspire to office needs to be ""don\'t be weak on defence and national security"". At this stage in the Corbyn project, these problems are not fixable. Labour under Corbyn has already been defined. It\'s all over bar the voting.'",922,2,0.0021691973969631237

When, however, being in the environment of people's experiences of WCA and claiming disability benefits daily it is easy to know just how much this process is harming people. It is extremely stressful for people who are very ill and in pain. The assessments are designed to remove people from benefits, cost more than they save and many lies and assumptions are recorded in the assessments which the claimant then has to appeal and without any income. A large number of people are committing suicide because the stress is too much, the threat of losing one's home is very real. People's lives are literally in the hands of the assessors who are not qualified to understand the illness, disability, mental health of any individual. Do you suppose it might be a better idea to talk to people who go through these experiences rather than try to ridicule or run down anyone who does talk to people daily who's health has been made much worse because of these assessments? There are many groups who deal with the enormous pressure people are going through and bogged down with trying to help so that less people die as result of the excess stress and being terrified of losing everything when what they need most are support and care. Don't you think the world would be a better place if we all took the time to understand? I honestly do not understand why people resent sick and disabled people the support needed..aside from possibly believing the tory/right wing rhetoric and such programmes like Benefit street distorting the reality of anyone claiming benefits being a scrounger, not a striver...in fact, talking with people daily who are sick and disabled I know these people are the hardest working people I know, striving to overcome prejudices, illness, limitations every minute of the day..many house and bed bound, many struggling to work when really they shouldn't be..and many who have been denied financial and practical support.

After almost every unpleasant incident, anywhere in UK, these four words are trotted out, and we all settle back into our armchairs, reassured. But, like almost everything else spouted by UK media and UK politicians, those four words are a blatant lie! Lessons are not learned. If they had been, we wouldn\'t have yet another heartbroken Police Widow! We wouldn\'t have more death on the street. We wouldn\'t be rushing to appease the guilty and suppress all criticism. Appeasement never works. You cannot appease a bully. Bullies scent weakness and keep pushing. Ask Neville Chaimberlain, who returned from a meeting with Hitler triumphantly waving his piece of paper. Millions died! We didn\'t learn that lesson. We never learn lessons. We British just stagger from crisis to disaster and back again. We have done so throughout history. We are never ready, always believing \'it\' won\'t happen. We always cut expenditure on defence and law enforcement, until we are backed into a corner and fighting for our lives. Somehow, we survive, no thanks to our so called leaders. But now we are facing a different foe, unlike anything we have ever faced before. Insidious, clever, secretive. Already well embedded into our society in positions of power and influence. Settled into every day life. And the home grown terrorists keep attacking. MI5 has admitted publicly that they are dealing with over 400 threats inside UK alone. They said it last night. And that\'s just the one\'s they admit to, or know about. We, as a nation and as a culture, are under attack from within, and we are in denial. So much in denial that we send an unarmed policeman to guard the very centre of our nation. He is now dead. His wife a widow, his children fatherless. Alone this brave man faced a fanatic with a knife, and he died. so no, politician, don\'t lie to me. Lessons have NOT been learned. The ropes and sails on Nelson\'s ships were rotten when he faced his enemy at Trafalgar. The Duke of Wellington had almost no heavy weapons to use at Waterloo. In both World Wars the British forces were under resourced and the politicians didn\'t believe war would come. And now, today, we send an unarmed policeman to guard the most sensitive establishment in Britain. It beggars belief. We, as a nation, rely on unarmed hero\'s. No hero should be unarmed, or alone when he faces an enemy. Lesson\'s have Not been learned by politicians. But the most important lesson, who the British people vote for, is in the voter\'s hands.

And the present lack of shame over his current multitasking is underlined by what seems to be a life rooted in detached insouciance. We should make allowance for this strange troubled creature. I would suggest he has some life sized cardboard cutouts made. The facial expression could be one of quiet trenchant certainty; yet tempered by a kindly light; and yet also with steely eyed conviction; and yet a sparkle of authentic sympathy. I am sure a skilled photographer could somehow accomplish this. With all emotional bases covered the cutouts could be distributed throughout his constituency where troubled folk could share their inner thoughts - a kind of political liturgy - with tea and cakes provided by the Conservative Club.

"""Luke Spencer-Harrop Re the Tax Research link. What Richard Murphy failed to do was look at the timing of borrowing, though he did account for inflation. For example, borrowed in 1960 when the economy was much smaller is treated the same as borrowed in 2015 when the economy was much larger. To me, the 2 are significantly different. Using a borrowing as a percentage of GDP would have been a better and more meaningful measure. It also makes sense to look at the size of the population you're asking to repay this debt. This would make per capita borrowing as a percentage of GDP an even better measure. I've used Richards data and combined it with GDP and mid-year population estimates and come to quite different conclusions. Both parties track record of per capita borrowing as a percentage of GDP is very volatile. Up to 2010 Labour trailed the Conservatives in that, since the start of the dataset they had higher cumulative per capita borrowing as a percentage of GDP per year in office. It was always the case that a severe recession or boom could tip the balance. Indeed, the record of borrowing is much much more closely correlated to the global macroeconomic environment the government found itself in that whether the government was red or blue. There are other factors which seem important to me that both I and Richard failed to account for. We didn't look at how much new public debt was incurred to finance investment spending. That's important in deciding whether new debt is prudent. Nor did we look at the effect of introducing time lags. For example, we both assumed that the fiscal position of the first year in office is attributable to the new government and isn't a hangover effect of the previous administration. Adding a 1 or 2 year time lag may well have produced different results. Nor did we look at the role played by private sector debt growth in increasing current GDP and tax revenues (lowerinf deficits) whilst depressing future GDP growth and tax revenues (increasing deficits). As an example, between May 2000 and May 2008 UK households took on an extra of private debt. That has massive fiscal impacts which show up as reduced deficits to 2008 and larger deficits when those debts are repaid. Lastly, Richards analysis totally omitted reference to the international picture whilst I only looked at in hindsight by visually comparing my graphs of UK per capita borrowing as a percentage of GDP to other country deficit trends. It might have been better to weight UK deficits as a percentage of GDP against a basket of developed nation countries. That way we wouldn't be scoring a year of high deficit spending badly when similar countries might have run even higher deficits than we did etc. Basically, Richard Murphy seems to be a busy man and though I'm certain he could have done, he didn't take the time to really get to grips with the data. This piece has been very widely shared in Labour circles as a case for Labours fiscal prudence, I'm sure way beyond Richard's expectations. It serves as an interesting starting point but is a million miles from being a full analysis. I hope to get back to this data once all my exams are out of the way in June. My spreadsheet needs a tidy up to make it more comprehensible to anybody but me and I want to account for some of the other factors I mentioned. As it stands though, the picture for both parties is very volatile and up to 2010 Labour had a record of higher per capita borrowing as a percentage of GDP. That reversed pretty quickly after 2010 placing the Conservatives as the higher borrowers. I strongly suspect adding just a 1 year time lag to all the data would shift the position back in the Conservatives favour. Adding in household debt growth is going to make the Labour record look terrible as they oversaw a massive housing bubble. That record might be redeemed somewhat if we remember that a lot of the last Labour government's borrowing was to fund investment which should possibly be discounted. Basically, it's messy and I wouldn't place very much weight on Richard's analysis and certainly not the weight that has been placed on it since it was published.""",729,0,0.0

"'Eu is not our largest market. Publication & records Research publications Research briefings UK-Commonwealth Trade House of Lords Library UK-Commonwealth Trade Published Friday, August 5, 2016 This House of Lords Library briefing examines the trade relationship between the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries. It provides a brief overview of UK trade, including information on its largest export market and largest source of imports. It then discusses Commonwealth trade, focussing on intra-Commonwealth trade. Finally it examines UK-Commonwealth trade relations and summarises a range of recent statements and commentary pertaining to the future of those trade relationships in the context of the European Union referendum result. Jump to full report >> UK Trade In 2015, the UK exported billion of goods and services and imported a total of billion. Consequently, the UK had a trade deficit of billion. The EU is the UK\'s largest trading partner. In 2015, 44 percent of the UK\'s goods and services were exported to the EU, while 53 percent of the UK\'s imports came from the EU. The value of the UK\'s trade deficit with the EU was billion. In 2015, the UK had a trade surplus in goods and services worth billion with non-EU countries. The UK exported goods and services valued at billion, while its imports were worth billion. In terms of trade with individual countries, the UK\'s largest export market in 2014 was the US, to which UK exports totalled billion. Germany was the largest source of imports into the UK in 2014, with the UK importing .8 billion of goods and services. Commonwealth Trade The Commonwealth Secretariat reports that in 2013, the total global exports of goods and services of the 53 Commonwealth members were valued at $3.4 trillion, which it stated was about 15 percent of the world\'s total exports. Intra-Commonwealth trade of goods and services totalled $592 billion in 2013. The total of intra-Commonwealth trade as a share of the Commonwealth\'s total global trade increased from 13 percent in 1995 to 18 percent in 2013. The Secretariat estimates that this trade had increased to $687 billion in 2015 and projects it to exceed $1 trillion by 2020. UK-Commonwealth Trade Relations In 2014, total UK exports to Commonwealth countries were worth billion, approximately 9 percent of the UK\'s total exports worldwide. Imports from the Commonwealth were billion, also around 9 percent of the UK total. The UK has had a trade surplus with the Commonwealth since 2011. In the context of the EU referendum, some commentators have suggested that an exit from the EU would enable the UK to establish bilateral agreements with countries such as India, Australia and New Zealand.

"'DEAR KEZIA Today the Scottish Parliament will begin a two-day debate on whether to seek permission to hold a second independence referendum. The Scottish government wants to hold a referendum in the autumn of 2018 or the spring of the following year AFTER the BREXIT TERMS have been made reasonably clear. It may well be that the Scottish government decide NOT to trigger a referendum IF the terms satisfy the priority interests of Scotland. You will lead the Scottish Labour Party against the motion, which is entirely your right, though Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of UK Labour, confirmed then denied that he had said Scotland has the right to hold as many referenda as it wants, depending on the will of the Scottish parliament. Today\'s news empahsises yet again what a shambles the Labour Party is in - even Neil Kinnock commented ""this is far worse than the 1980s"". So go ahead and lead Scottish Labour against the motion under debate. BUT be warned. The true enemy is NOT the SNP; it is the Tories under Ruth Davidson whose ambition is annihilate the Labour Party in Scotland. Maggie Thatcher once declared her aim was to destroy Socialism forever in the UK; an aim that has been taken up by Theresa May. You yourself have become a laughing stock at Holyrood during the First Minister\'s Question Time as you stand up and PARROT whatever Ruth Davidson has just said. Davidson reads her script, sits down, and you stand up and echo what she has just said. The chamber is laughing before you finish your first sentence. Once this debate is over, the Tories will return to trying to decimate Labour councils throughout Scotland. You are most unlikely to survive the debacle that follows UNLESS you get out to preaching LABOUR VALUES - which, the independence issue aside are not that different, from SNP values: SOCIAL DEMOCRACY. Finally, it may well be that Scotland does NOT choose to leave the UK... BUT it will have a greivance than can only be assuaged by further DEVOLUTUION amounting to a FEDERAL UNION between the nations. Whether or not this would be a further step on the road to independence only time and the Will of the Scottish people can decide. Yours sincerely The Sage of Auchtermuchy'",382,0,0.0

"'SUBVERTING DEMOCRACY Theresa May\'s decision lto say \'no\' to a request from the democratically-elected Scottish Parliament for a Section 30 order that would allow an independence referendum to take place on the same basis as the 2014, reversed more than four decades of British government policy, which since the days of Harold Wilson has been that Scotland can only remain part of the United Kingdom by consent. Margaret Thatcher always stated that if the SNP won a majority of Scottish seats at Westminster, that would in itself be a mandate for independence. By the time that target was actually met under David Cameron in 2015, it was felt that a referendum was the more appropriate way of securing a mandate. But the constant has been that Scotland has a clearly-understood democratic path to independence which it can take at a time of its choosing. No more. The new Theresa May doctrine is that there is literally no way Scotland can express a view on its own future, until such time as the PM decides for her own reasons that she is ready. She makes no bones about the fact that the time may never come, and that a key strand of the democratic process in Scotland may remain indefinitely suspended. Mrs. May\'s argument is that of the would-be tyrant who wins one democratic election and says : ""We don\'t need any more elections. Not in five years, not in ten, not in twenty. That one was fine."" The SNP received 46.5% of the constituency vote in the 2016 election that\'s a bigger mandate than any UK government has received at a Westminster general election since 1966, more than five decades ago. There are very few governing parties anywhere in Western Europe, either at national or regional level, that can boast of stronger public support than the SNP. If it is to be seriously claimed that the Scottish government do not have a mandate to act, it\'s impossible to think of a government anywhere that has a mandate to do anything. Certainly not the \'majority\' Tory government in London, which was elected on the basis of just 37% of the UK-wide vote (and less than 15% of the Scottish vote)and which is led by en unelected Prime Minister. One image will linger long in the memory that of the defeated Scottish opposition leader Ruth Davidson being tasked with announcing what the elected Scottish government would not be allowed to do.

"'There was a lot of bragging around the time of the referendum about the UK having the 4th or 5th largest economy in the world, the argument being everyone would want to trade (tariff-free) with us, whether we were in the EU or not, because we constituted such a substantial market. In August 2016, less than two months after the referendum, a report, entitled ""International Manufacturing Statistics"", was published by the Conservative government and no one seems to have batted an eyelid. A cursory read-through reveals some unbelievably worrying statistics, which I thought I would share on the eve of the government\'s triggering of Brexit. The essence of the report is that our manufacturing sector, the sector in which we make goods to sell internally and to other countries, is in serious decline. (See link below.) Here are three key points of the report. 1. The UK has slipped from being the 5th or 6th leading manufacturing nation in the world (from 1970 to 2004) to being 9th in 2014. Germany, France, Italy, China, USA, Japan, India and South Korea all produce more than we do. 2. In terms of productivity the UK now ranks 29th (!!!) in the world in terms of output per head. We are THE least productive country in the whole of western Europe in this respect, barring Spain. We are less productive than the Italians, French, Irish, Belgians, Finns, Austrians, Norwegians, etc. (the list goes on and on). We are 3 times less productive than the Swiss, more than 2 times less productive than the Germans and 33% less productive than the Dutch. We are ridiculously poorly educated, low-skilled and poorly-paid, compared with other countries, and this why our productivity is so woeful in this respect. 3. In terms of the percentage that the manufacturing sector contributes to GDP we are now 116th (!!!) in the world. In 115 countries manufacturing contributes more to the wealth of the nation than in the UK. Only 11% (more or less 1/10th) of our GDP comes from our manufacturing sector. It is staggering that these statistics were not revealed to the British people in the run-up to the referendum. They highlight the true state of the fragility of the UK economy and how little, in reality, we have to sell to those countries we are now hoping to set up trade agreements with. http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05809/SN05809.pdf'",396,6,0.015151515151515152

On the 15th of July, 2016, Theresa May told First Minister Nicola Sturgeon she was ""willing to listen to options"" on Scotland\'s future relationship with the European Union. The prime minister said: ""I\'m willing to listen to options and I\'ve been very clear with the first minister today that I want the Scottish government to be fully engaged in our discussion."" Since then, Mrs May has done exactly the opposite by REFUSING TO EVEN DISCUSS THE OPTIONS presented by the Scottish government. During that meeting in July 2016,Mrs May declared (1) Scotland is an EQUAL partner in the UK, and (b) Scotland should take the LEAD in helping to getting the best out of any new politicial system. Doesn\'t that sound hollow and hypocritical now? By refusing to discuss these options, Mrs May FORCED Miss Sturgeon to request permission to hold a second independence, not tomorrow, not next week, not ecen next year, but 18 months from now when FACTS about the UK\'s exit from the EU will be known. If it turns out as Mrs May keeps assuring us it will, the case for Scottish independence might collapse, so Mrs May has little to lose in granting permssion. After all, the First Minister of Scotland and her Scottish government WERE ELECTED by the people of Scotland to represent them. Theresa May HAS NEVER BEEN ELECTED by anyone. Nicola Sturgeon shows the utmost respect for the sovreignty of her Parliament; Theresa May attempts to undermine it by forcing the issue to go to the Supreme Court who threw her out by a vote of 11 to 1. David Cameron will go down in the history of the UK as the Prime Minister who gambled his country\'s place in the EU and lost it. Theresa May will almost certainly go fown in history as the Prime Minister who risked the unity of the UK and lost Scotland. When the people of Scotland realise the humiliating way Theresa May has treated their country, they will not forget and they will not forget. Theresa May should keep in mind the face of Maggie Thatcher, tears and misery on her face, as she left 10 Downing Street for the last time.
