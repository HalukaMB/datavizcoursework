Neter-Khert became affixed to Egypt as the land of bondage in Semitic lore.

The benefits for the economy are well-known. They'll spend more boosting the economy and they'll also think about saving for their future taking a burden off the state in terms of pensions not to mention the savings in terms of benefits. In work benefits sounds so wrong, why is someone working but can't earn enough to feed their family? The comments saying every business should be able to afford the rises is just ridiculous. What is a business? If you're thinking of Starbucks then maybe. But some smaller businesses have huge staff costs, look at nurseries, parents are paying about the average take home salary per month just to look after one of their children. Yet the nurseries are struggling and forced to pass on costs to parents. They can't do much about it because they need to hire two lots of staff, as shifts are very long, they need to give their workers some time off for lunch etc. This is an example where just changing the minimum wages creates problems. The government says it wants to move from low wages, high benefits to the opposite, which is one of the most obvious policies to announce but important nevertheless. The government must support small to medium sized businesses when they increase the minimum wage in either tax cuts or employer national insurance contributions. Bigger companies such as Lidl and Aldi have led the way choosing salaries above minimum wage and closer to living wage. They get their staff to be more productive and pay them well. We are very unproductive around 30% less productive than our closest neighbours, the French. We also work more hours and have a lower minimum wage.

In the UK 93% of all private sector employment is by SME's. Businesses with 50 employees or less. Your employer who pays you by PAYE also pays employers NIC and is now liable to pay into a pension for you. Plus insurance, holiday pay, sick pay, maternity/paternity pay, training and in work benefits. As an employer, the wage you get costs the business 25% more as a minimum. So a salary costs in real terms to the business. As for profits, there is a minimum 20% corporation tax to take off. There has to be a reward for the risk of starting and running a business.

A ""living wage"" is surely enough total income to meet a socially acceptable standard of living. That is not the same as a ph minimum wage rate. Try working one shift a week on ph. Is that a living wage? Besides, plenty of low paid workers are not in households which are in poverty. Often we\'re talking about young workers living with parents on reasonable salaries or the second income for a couple, or pensioners with an additional income stream. These people don\'t really depend on the low pay to survive so much as to provide extras.Low pay may be associated with poverty but does not automatically signify it. I can think of nothing I could legally do which would induce an employer to pay me the minimum wage rate Labour is proposing. I just don\'t see the value of my output as being that high. Why should an employer be forced to pay more than my worth when I\'m quite willing to be realistic and accept less? Would you have Labour make me unemployed of forced to work illegally cash in hand? This idea that businesses are failing because they can\'t afford to pay ph seems wrongheaded. A business is failing if it can\'t afford to keep going. Placing large onerous obstacles in their way is a sure way to trip a few up. "" per hour is just about a living wage for 40 hours work."" Haha, yeah, I\'d really struggle if I were to only have 4 times what I currently spend to live on. My last employer decided that running a pub was a mugs game too. The final straw for him was minimum wages rising to .20. Now he has the security of a normal job with regular pay, a lot less stress and half the hours he used to work. He also has just over a dozen fewer employees, well actually he now has none.'",b'Lee Tay',2017-04-10 19:18:45,2

If wages go up does that create more or less disposable income? More, question no 2. What are companies likely to do, for example, supermarkets who have been involved in price wars for I'd say over a decade? Are they going to say mmm more money for goods and increase the prices? Or will the price war simply continue as it has done so far. That's my ignorant knowledge part. Now, I've gone away and researched inflation, and you're looking at cost-push inflation, the idea that companies will pass on the cost of rising wages. Yes that is a possibility, in my original comment I said that we must ensure that the government introduces this in a way that doesn't affect small to medium sized businesses and I gave the example of childcare places like nurseries. Childcare costs are very high and companies are struggling as there are long days (requiring two lots of staff to be hired, and legal limits to the number of staff per child). The increased wages will increase the spend in the local economy as someone else pointed out. But again, as I previously mentioned, it could tackle our woefully low productivity and we are around 30% less productive than French workers. Even a very modest increase in productivity would help the economy greatly. The reason why the government should soften the blow to SME's is that it should fit the reducing need for in work benefits which is a long term structural issue that would be worth funding for at least 3 years. Employer NI is possibly the easiest way to offer a rebate and allow them to keep their staff and hire more if they want to. The government subsises wages anyway. There is a deliberate refusal of many to analyse the pros and cons. There are issues with this policy but my proposal is hopefully one answer to the main drawback and that leaves well I could probably name 5 huge benefits this policy would bring.""",b'Jack Miller',2017-04-10 17:33:15,0

When you pay people a living wage that they can actually live on. So that they don't have to worry about paying the rent putting food on the table and paying other bills. The have more disposable income. Now guess what they do with that disposable income. They save some and they spend some. Guess where they spend it. Mostly in their local small businesses. So therefor the profits of those businesses go up. Which in turn means they can afford to pay their employees more while still turning a profit. That's basically how it works. Go look at places that pay a living wage now a real one. And you will see not only does it benefit the employees but it also benefits the economy over all. Now their are other things that need to go hand in hand with a living wage to ensure it works. First of close all the tax loopholes and Haven's and claw back the billions we are owed in unpaid taxes. Secondly tie that living wage to the rate of inflation with incremental changes depending on where you live. so that you are always able to live on that wage. Thirdly rent controls. To ensure that greedy landlords can rip off their tenants by jacking up rents. By creating a real living wage and following the above steps then everybody wins. But the only way any of that happens is by voting for j.c and labour. *************ADDENDUM***************** One more point I would like to add. We also need to RE work our system of taxation. To ensure that it is fair representative and proportionate. The current system is massively unfair with those least able to afford it shouldering the majority of the fiscal responsibility. While those who can afford to pay more try and do every trick and twist in the book to pay as little as they can get away with. And it appears to me as if those in society who are the most well of are the same ones who pay the least amount of tax.""",b'Robert Andrew Crawford',2017-04-10 11:26:25,20

I'm not an economist I'm not even very good with maths. But to me this is just common sense. There has been a massive redistribution of wealth from the poorest in our society to the wealthiest. It's time to redress the balance. People in full time employment should not have make a choice between eating and heating. The only reason why a living wage is not a thing now is because of the greed and opulence of a few. Who's only goal is to accumulate as much wealth and power as they can. It just goes to show how far the rot has set in and how well spun the lies are that people can even suggest that a living wage is a bad idea. In fact in a true democracy they would be protesting in the streets to demand it.

If you think back when the minimum wage was first discussed everyone was up in arms saying loads of businesses would go to the wall. Yes some did but that was probably because of the exterminate interest rates charged by banks etc, the ridiculous business rates, high rents, the hike on VAT. Getting back to your original question I don\'t want the small business man to be out of pocket but I do want people to be paid a living wage. Sorry keep adding to this but in America where they are facing similar economic struggles to this country many states have voted for the $15 dollar an hour minimum wage.

""surly for you haters any Labour is better that Tory"" Possibly, but when this Labour will drive the party further from power then a DIFFERENT Labour is better than THIS Labour. Hence the infighting to get rid of the current leadership. What would be the effect of the whole party getting behind the current leadership? Wouldn\'t it just create the impression that the whole of the party was out to lunch, rather than just the current leadership? That would be even more damaging to public perceptions. Besides, the rest of the PLP have equally firmly held political beliefs.

We allowed for the fact that Russia was helping him to fight ISIS but three things didn\'t weigh up. \r The time it is taking to defeat ISIS- Russia\'s war style would have taken them out immediately with some disregard to civilians. Russia could have routed their army as ISIS moves in convoys. Russia was using ISIS as a cover to slow down their removal for her own ends, though Russia also genuinly wants rid of them as much as we do. There is no room for terrorists with anybody.\r That Russia has bombed Western supported rebel groups in Syria, enemies of President Assad, more than she has fought ISIS, because she sapped their strength when she could see they were defeating ISIS too quickly for her own advent into Syria to be ultimately long-term. Russia has been biding for time to become long-established in Syria in the eyes of the world. Why would she want to leave a country she has defended so nobly? Russia has been slowly creeping in to Syria and we must tell Russia to leave now.\r That Russia hangs onto an elected leader when his majority electorate wouldn\'t have him after his deeds when he took office. Russia should have called new elections immediately in Syria. When civil war followed only a vote. Only a job as President another better man could be found to fill. Yet Russia allowed the Assad personality cult to dominate as one man.\r And maybe a fourth, for Russia refused to move over and out when President Trump asked them: ""Now I am in office, why not just let me finish ISIS off?"" And Russia, never having complained about the expense of war, refused with a moot excuse that there was an obligation to President Assad, and how Russia wanted rid of ISIS. Suspiciously only too glad to help. And she is planning to keep her version of a divided Syria by spending billions of roubles more for a permanent future there\r Russia is self-serving whilst she helps the enemies of the West we wanted rid of. We asked ourselves ""why is Russia bombing the rebel opposition the USA and the UK support, when they are fighting ISIS, everyone\'s first priority - or are they? For Russia is planning a long-term presence and is still in the initial stages of forming her military base at the port of Latakia. To do this and slowly creep into Syria permanently she has slowed down her operations against ISIS to an almost amateur guerilla war level. Russia could have wiped ISIS out single-handedly a long time ago. Biding her time in case she loses her ally, Assad, to far off elections when she will say she is established in Latakia and cannot leave after Syria finds peace. Russia wants a hostile, divided world and a strong presence in the Middle East. \r And why is President Assad also side-tracked from defeating ISIS, and bombing his political military Syrian opponents in the face of the USA, instead of asking for or promising elections after the known expected demise of ISIS, not very far off? Well, we know it is to stay in power as long as he can and Assad will be happy for a Russian presence in Syria to last a very long time as his strong friend. But he has been using war against ISIS as a cover for largely targetting those enemy rebel groups whilst telling Russia he had intelligence that ISIS was amongst them he had to annhiliate. Russia has no real interest in Assad except to bide time and fool the West that they are only there for the same reason as we are, to fight ISIS. Assad knows only Russia will have him and the West does not want hostilities there.\r Assad isn\'t the only Soviet puppet. Latakia port will be the prime puppet show when Russia will divide and rule, hoping the West will leave a government too afraid of Russia and under Assad preferably. A Punch and Judy show to continue to fool the West. We need to blow their cover now before Russia gets a firm foothold in Syria. The Syrian people deserve peace, freedom and democracy. Not a larger, more real and far more dangerous permanent threat than the brief interlude of terrorist ISIS. The whole Middle East will go under Communist domination in the future if Russia stays in Syria. Russia will be biding her time again.....'",b'Glenys Pearson',2017-04-09 13:07:40,0

Everyone aligned to Jeremy is determined to defend him to the hilt. The fact that the party is the worst it's been polling for decades means nothing as long as Jerome is in power. Labour is more than and always has been more than one person. We can argue about what new labour did, the point is look at what is happening to our country now. Why aren't labour raising the point that the tories are borrowing more now than new labour ever did? Why aren't we seriously opposing the most important change to our constitution by a potentially illegitimate government? Why is there speculation that democratically elected MPs can be deselected by johnny come lately labour members rather than the constituents that voted them in? We've become a shambles. You can delude yourself all you want. There's no denying Ed miliband even polled better than Jeremy Corbyn at the same stage. If you've been a labour supporter for as long as you say you have to accept that we can only change things if we are in government. We are in no shape to do that.

It is about more than one person - it is about policy. The LP are raising the point that the Tories are borrowing more now than the LP ever did. If you do not want to say the word Brexit - let's get it out - Corbyn is right. I do not like that Leave won but every party and every party leader said before the vote they would honour the outcome - what type of Brexit is a different matter - there is a whole slew of parliamentary, legal and stakeholder avenues in order to shape Brexit over the next 2yrs and the LP have been and are working on them all. On mandatory reselection and/or deselection (for cause) these are party policy and local CLP matters - always have been. The LP is a Shambles and only Corbyn is keeping it together. Ed Miliband suffered Coups of his own and then was hobbled by the most awful election campaign ever - this was lead by Progress (in fact it was the reason Progress was set up - LP members and TUs dared to elect EdM - who was 'too left' for Lord Sainsbury. So he withdrew his funding from the LP in general and only funded those who signed up to his new organisation). I agree the LP needs to get into power but both the campaigns of EdM and Brown proved that the old - tell the public anything then do what we think is right and make excuses for a lack of political courage - was not going to work anymore. That way lost us Scotland and the Labour Heartlands - I know I was there. Getting into shape to fight the next election is being hampered party in-fighting and it has to stop.

There are about 800k kids in each school year (based on population data and assuming all kids go to state schools). This policy extends FSM to an extra 4 years (6 primary years, 2 of which are already free). So, .6 bn must feed 3.2m kids. That gives a budget of per pupil. The 2012 pilot study cost only per pupil.

You\'re not going to end that by getting rid of private schools. Those parents will still be able to pay for private tutors, summer crammers, encourage more factual based TV viewing habits, go to museums and other \'culturally enriching\' activities in holidays, buy more books, have more enlightening dinner table conversations etc. I\'m not quite sure why you\'d wish to prevent any parent from acting in what they think is their child\'s best interest If you want to address the unfair advantages some kids gain from being born to the right parents, start with taxing parents on income and wealth, not penalising them for making decisions about how they wish to spend post-tax incomes because they don\'t fit in with Labour ""state is best"" ethos. My main concern is that I don\'t see why the state should be paying more to support some kids than others, except say in cases of illness and disability. As it stands the state pays around pa to educate kids in the public system, whereas the kids in the private system don\'t receive this public spending. It seems a bit much to then ask that the parents of privately educated kids to pay for the dinners of kids who are already getting a much better deal from the state than their own kids are. I quite like the idea of universal benefits but this policy doesn\'t do that. There are no free lunches for secondary school kids, the packed lunchers, or the home educated, or the privately educated. If you want to achieve universal benefits, set child benefit for all kids at a level sufficient to pay for a kid\'s basic survival. Don\'t start with policies only benefitting those who are of the right age, make the right decision as to what sort of school to attend and are prepared to be fed state gruel. As I mentioned above, the biggest effects of this policy do not seem to be alleviation of hunger or removal of stigma but a transfer of wealth to the parents of primary school kids who already pay for school dinners.'",b'Lee Tay',2017-04-09 13:58:00,1

Thorn berry only had a small chance to talk about ti this morning. She recalled the different colour of dinner tickets. Of course, the administration is nothing like than now and is very discreet. Dinner ladies have posted that they were not have clue who the free school meals kids are. So, to sum up, we have free school meals already until Year 2, those that need them after get them, if system needs to be extended then good, it is not a new policy and latterly a Lib-Dem one, and most importantly it has nor been proven to work looking at the study the Labour party has chosen to use itself.

Attack on British soldiers in Palestine by terrorists Attacks on Troops These could be by sniper or bomb or could take the form of kidnapping and then murder, holding for a while and/or public flagellation. Humiliation was and still is a deliberate weapon there. A particularly barbaric attack was the kidnapping, torture and murder of Sergeant Clifford Martin and Sergeant Mervyn Paice which led to difficulty in controlling enraged troops in Tel Aviv, anti-Zionist riots in England and condemnation by people worldwide, including Jewish groups (though no assistance in finding the murderers). Snipers could pick men off in the streets, manning roadblocks or even in barracks any time; the orange groves, hills and rocky terrain of Palestine providing plenty of cover. The pointless killing of Cpl Short, 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards near Jaffa was typical. Nowadays the practice is more refined and snipers have an officer with them who singles out particular targets in protests. A unit was always in danger and a particularly heinous attack was that which killed 7 men, mostly unarmed and in bed, of 5 Para in Tel Aviv.

Some families have been living like that for years and have lost all motivation. The way to tackle that though in not to give every child of primary school age a free meal every day. We know that bikes are healthy for kids. They encourage exercise and fight obesity but we would never consider buying a bike for every child.What we should be doing is getting parents into work, building their skills and qualifications, and raising their income levels.

Many families can afford school lunches, so they don't need government subsidies. The stigma associated with receiving free or reduced lunches can be eliminated by using a ticket system (either paper tickets or electronic systems parents pay into if needed) so that students can't tell who paid what. Even upgrading to an electronic system would be significantly cheaper than funding all the lunches. Also, it is unfair to fund this through taxes on private school fees. I can tell you for a fact that there are many parents sacrificing a great deal to send their child to private schools. They are already funding state schools through National Insurance and council tax contributions, so they should not essentially be triple taxed. It feels as if you are punishing those who choose not to use the state school route. And with how oversubscribed many state schools are, the worst thing would be to tax children out of the private sector and into the state.

If you choose the bigger car, you pay more because it pollutes more. You have the choice to either pay the fees or buy a smaller car.

However, private school children save the government money. They don't have to pay the educational costs for that child, leaving more money per child in that local authority (of course, the amounts still might not be sufficient due to austerity cuts, but that's another issue). The VED comparison doesn't fit. From my understanding, the government is expecting private schools to provide services to the community as part of their not for profit status. Opening up facilities for the community and state schools to use. Allowing state school pupils to attend undersubscribed specialist classes in secondary school or sending those specialist teachers into the state schools. Allowing state school students to participate in some of the extracurricular activities. Offering state school teachers the opportunity to attend training days, or offering training days at state schools. Offering bursaries to low income students in the community. Or even sponsoring a state school that is switching to academy status. These seem like more suitable expectations for private schools that will benefit the educational experiences of the state school pupils. If private schools are expected to add value to the community in exchange for their tax exempt status, then a tax cannot be added to the fees.""",b'Monica Gilbert',2017-04-10 15:13:36,0

Of this, 32 per cent in Newham and 46 per cent in Durham was deadweight cost (that is, involved paying for meals that would otherwise have been paid for by parents). Other initiatives targeting similar outcomes, such as the Jamie Oliver \'Feed Me Better\' campaign, appeared to be able to deliver significant impacts at substantially lower cost."" If 46% of the money spent on the scheme in Durham (chosen because it was an area of high deprivation) was effectively spending, not on improving nutritional standards in schools, but increasing the disposable incomes of parents whose children already ate school meals, how much more will be wasted in areas of average or even high levels of affluence? Why should parents who are already saving the public purse the cost of a school place be expected to raise the incomes of ordinary parents up and down the country by charging VAT on top of what they pay already so they get to feed all primary school kids? One of the key features of the current system is that it enables teachers to identify children who receive free school meals who may also need help and due consideration in other areas of school life. Free school meals for all means this marker is lost to teachers who will be less able to bear individual circumstances in mind in their dealings with and approach to kids. The policy is nuts.

How about the billion handed over to the banks by us taxpayers? Now that\'s a handout! AUSTERITY IS A CON. The deficit has soared by billion more since the Tories took office because their plan isn\'t working. It isn\'t ""living within our means,"" it\'s pulling the plug. Economic growth depends on high wages, good skills & disposable income... all of which are under attack from cuts to schools, public services & pay. The soaring costs of housing, rent & university won\'t help matters. The economy will stagnate. Austerity is an excuse for the Tories to raid the economy for the benefit of the rich, selling off tax payer-funded assets (the NHS, railways) to privateers, so they in turn can make even more profit from you. If that\'s not bad enough, billion a year in tax is left uncollected from corporations. And, worst of all, this government are attacking the disabled & under-funding the NHS in real terms. Why? Because they don\'t care. They opposed the creation of the NHS in 1945. Do you honestly think the Conservatives will put a stop to cheap migrant labour either? The Tories only care about big business & shrinking the size of government. It\'s a free-for-all for the richest and you\'re lapping it up. 80% of UK newspapers are owned by 5 tax-dodging billionaires - the press want you talking about anything other than the big austerity con.

But the bigger issue is people cannot believe Jeremy Corbyn is a strong leader because he simply does not understand that some people are horrible individuals. He is incredibly nieve!! And senior members of the Labour Party disagree with him. Nothing new there...It is sad to see Labour lurch to the far left and expect to win an election. The public I feel will not vote for somebody that they see as from the past and is seen as weak, no matter that I think Jeremy has some fine qualities. That is why it was suggested to call a snap election by a certain Conservative - William Haig. Because he thought they would wipe out Labour. That will be the case (sadly) weither we have a General Election now or futher down the road. The Conservatives are (as usual) ripping up their Manifesto and doing what ever they want - and had previously denied. Raising NI and so on. In past years it was VAT...And unfortunately we have a leader who is unable to capitalize on these opportunities.'",b'Stephen Elliott',2017-04-08 13:28:38,0

What Trump did was launch an attack over an accusation he himself put on Assads shoulders, there is absolutely no evidence for the claim he caused the attack, he has nothing to gain and everything to lose by doing so to. UN resolution 2118 was a 2013 motiob that saw Syria give up all such weapons and facilities to the UN for destruction and submitted to regular UN inspections to ensure maintainence of the article, which the UN still maintains Syria has done exactly so. Whereas when Aleppo was liberated humanitarian workers found chemical agents within the rebel terrorist strongholds in terrorist controlled areas. These are the facts as we know them.

In the early 50s, Mohammed Mossadegh, the country's democratically elected prime minister, began making efforts to nationalize the country's oil industry, which had been largely controlled by the British and French the CIA and MI6 instigated a coup against him in 1953. The resulting conflict returned Iran to the authoritarian yet Westernized rule of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. This move would have dire consequences in 1979, when radical Islamists hijacked popular outrage at the Shah's foreign-sponsored dictatorship and channelled it into the Islamic Revolution, which led to the oppressive government of religious clerics we know today.

They reported today the negative side of people who gathered for a 'stop the war' demonstration. a democratic right of the people to do such things when politicians can endanger the lives of their loved ones in any military confrontation. But other than say this, the BBC took the view that a Syrian refugee was 'opposed' by the group. This again shows that the BBC is not the true news, but a propaganda machine for a bad government that did not even investigate to obtain unequivocal evidence (not just photos showing the 'white helmets' pulling so-called victims out of the rubble straight after the attack that released the chemicals. Indeed the British and US governments only assume and where if Sarin had been used, why were not the 'white helmets' wearing complete medical and chemical warfare sealed suits or even gloves or masks, as Sarin according to the WHO only takes a pinhead droplet to kill a human and is over 20-times more deadly than cyanide. If the BBC reported these facts as well they would have a balanced view of the outside world, but they never do having observed their news reporting for over 50 years. The people need the truth and both sides of the coin BBC and you as a so-called independent news outlet should know that. So why are you not doing it? War as we know is the most destructive of all human activities and Jeremy is right in questioning such retaliatory action. May on the other hand just accepts what the US administration says and she acts as their political poodle. That is not we want in a PM and another reason why the man of 'reasonableness' Jeremy Corbyn will make a far safer' and better prime minister than May. For once war is effective, it is very hard to stop as history has shown us all who are old enough to witness such death and destruction that war unleashes. And we know also that ministers and politicians (who are always safe and nowhere near the carnage of war) do not lose their lives in fighting for so-called democracy and their perceived threats, but normal working and middle class people who account for 90% of the make-up of the British people.

There is no doubt (I trust the MSF medics & white helmet witnesses) that Sarin was used in the recent attack and that is delivered by aircraft launched ordnance or gun shell ordnance as the Sarin weapons are based on mixing the final precursors in the weapon after launch. That probably explains the use of two chemical weapons at the same time. The real issue for me is not that the Syrian regime would use such weapons they have a long record of doing so but they declared, with Russian support, that they had destroyed/removed their stockpile of chemical weapons. So either they have retained undeclared stocks of chemical weapons in breach of agreed, even by Russia, UN resolutions or have acquired new stocks if so from where? There is no evidence that backs up the Russian's claim that a weapons store was hit and the pattern and distribution of casualties does not support that hypothesis either. The UN Security Council has consistently failed to protect the people of Syria mainly because of Russian & Chinese vetos of resolutions. We have to find a UN solution including a UN Chapter VII Article 42 - 51 intervention by a UN force if necessary.

Assad is clearly on a winning streak and had every chance of staying in some sort of power once the 'rebels' had been defeated. He had no need to create the international condemnation and possible reaction that would follow the use of chemical weapons. But, reading this, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/the-dead-were-wherever-you-looked-inside-syrian-town-after-chemical-attack there's little to indicate that rebels had a stockpile of chemical weapons in the area either. Now, I'm no expert, but Assad comes over as being pretty shrewd. You don't get to cling on as dictator for long if you're not. Is he fully in control of his military? Are there some loose cannons and a weakness in the command structure and Assad is sat there seething at whatever dumb son of a ----- in his army did this? Certainly, US policy which can turn on a dime does nothing to aid stability. It's always good to be able to predict how all parties will react to any move by another party in a tense and multi-faceted conflict. Jeremy is the opposite. He's so predictable in defence matters you can set your watch by him. He'll call for ceasefire and diplomacy and the rule of international law in all matters. He seems impervious to the fact that where people stand to gain more by changing facts on the ground than by talking things through, diplomacy will fail. Besides, it's quite obvious that many of rebels don't want to talk. Putin must be quite upset that their pet dog is ill-mannered and has fleas, but it's the only dog they have in this contest. It's a bloody mess.""",b'Lee Tay',2017-04-07 07:17:31,0

My point is, if you draw a line, no matter where it is, someone's innocent child (children have no control over their circumstances), is losing out. Our brains need food for good mental health. Good mental health means they take in more at school, get better educations, have better chances at higher education, and can contribute to society in lore ways than manual labour jobs. How will we fill the skills gaps that are emerging, now that many EU citizens are going home before Brexit has even got into full flow? If we don't help everyone, the poor kids (like mine), will end up rail roaded into fruit picking, while the kids with the private educations and parents in high places will have the money to walk straight into higher education, and the social power to get them into better universities. We might be poor, but my child is not stupid, so why should him, and his peers, even the ones with the parents that smoke and drink, not get to play on the same playing field? This policy is designed to even the playing field for ALL. The tories introduced free school meals for KS1 kids (4-7yr olds), and left the schools and local authorities to foot the bill. At least JC is looking to fund it. And i pay tax on tampons and I don't choose to bleed. These people choose to put their kids into private schools for + a year to get them 'ahead of the rest'. And these private schools still get the same government funding per head as the other schools, but they claim to offer a better education because they have more money for education. Our local private school just closed because it's education quality was dire, but it was still a year. Worse than the LA schools. Maybe we should charge private schools a levy from their profit rather than hit the parents? Socialism is meant to be about equality and fairness for EVERYONE, not what's in it for me and my kid, cause while things might be sweet one day, your circumstances can change the next, without you wanting them to, and when we have an us and them, suddenly you become one of them...""",b'Vicki Van Transit',2017-04-07 02:33:11,1

It's all very well saying that it's up to the parents to provide for their children but they're not always going to break the cycle of poor parenting handed down through generations off their own backs. Getting through to the youngest of generations, educating them on how to behave and be valuable members of society regardless of their upbringing and social status is the way to ensure that future generations don't fall back on living on handouts through choice or resorting to criminality. If their parents are going to be useless then the schools should at least inspire them to want to follow a brighter, alternative path and to show them how to access it. I'm not sure offering school meals to all children is necessary and it should probably be means tested, however I do like the idea that children whose parents are failing them could be nurtured and fed properly. Any decent human being wants that for a child, even if it's not their own. I really think class sizes need to come down too and that more vocational subjects could be offered for those that aren't as academically minded.

Also, unless we dedicated ourselves full-time and using every inch of garden we would never be able to entirely meet our own consumption needs. We are also looking into keeping chickens and again, even without the cost of the coop, feeding and cleaning costs make it cheaper to buy eggs from the supermarket unless I start a mini battery farm and squeeze in 30 at a time and kill them every year for meat (again another full-time occupation). It's the same with making my own clothes; the cost of fabrics and notions make it much cheaper to buy from the high street. In fact I often buy a cheap items from Primark just for the Zips/buttons because it's cheaper than buying these notions in a haberdashery. Nice fabric is particularly pricey. All these people who spout crap about self-sufficiency have obviously never tried it. It's a popular middle-class hobby because outlay costs are too expensive for poor families. Yes once you have the set up and the skills, a little bit of begging, borrowing and ingenuity might keep you going without much cash, but you need that initial investment. I like the idea of skilling-up the long-term unemployed and disabled people looking for an occupation, to have the skills for self-sufficiency. However, as it was during the war this involves bringing these subjects into school, starting nationwide schemes and providing grants. In fairness, after brexit it might be cheaper to get poor people growing veggies than importing veggies with huge tariffs so not entirely a bad idea.

We are now seemingly wanting, relying upon the government to feed our children....put food in thee bellies of our own kids. I will never ever, till that day I die agree with this. As a parent it is my pride, my pleasure, my honour, my responsibility to put food on the plate of my own children. That's what mums and dads do. More than this 99.% of parents forced to make a choice would without any hesitation whatsoever go hungry to feed their children. I certainly would. Now, don't get me wrong those parents who are having real problems putting food on the plates of their children? This needs to be looked at of course it does. However, a carpet policy of all children receiving free meals regardless of parents financial situation can never be right. Surely (Surely) one of the most fundamental things a parent has to do....is too feed their own children. Surely......we can not, and must not take away one of the most primal things a parent or any animal in the jungle must do......feed their own young. How dare the government (Bloody fruit cake labour party) how dare they seek too take away my pride, my privilege my honour of feeding my own children. How dare they!!! This can never be right. Removing the responsibility from parents of feeding their own children shocks me too the core. What's going to happen next? Free kids under pants at school? Free shirts? Free ice creams? For Christ sake as a society how have we ever allowed society to abandon its responsibilities in such an awful way. Once again, don't get me wrong parents who do not have the money to feed their kids is one thing but this utter nonsense of free school meals for all is the brainless reasoning of the labour party. The labour party under Corbyn is doomed just doomed. Decent working people are being mislead by the labour party like never ever before. Is there anyone who owns a brain who would support this. Too me, it beggars belief. One of the things I have valued most is caring for my own children. This can never be right""",b'Anthony Brewin',2017-04-06 06:46:53,2

These kids already plenty of issues to handle, its good to give them one less. 3 Even attentive parents can have some unprepared days, where they just throw in junk food for their kids to eat.

With a larger number of children having school meals it will be easier to guarantee a good menu, it will also tak some pressure off Teacher and LSA's who would otherwise need to gather a lunch menu for certain kids each day. (Every little bit of extra stress we take off their plates is worth it - Teaching Jobs are extremely overloaded!). 5) One more reason, that is not as insignificant as it sounds Doing blankett free meals for all, means less paperwork for schools, they wont have to fill in forms claiming the money back from government.

These kids already plenty of issues to handle, its good to give them one less. 3 Even attentive parents can have some unprepared days, where they just throw in junk food for their kids to eat. This will ensure that doesn't happen. 4) ) Making it free will ensure more parent really on it. With a larger number of children having school meals it will be easier to guarantee a good menu, it will also tak some pressure off Teacher and LSA's who would otherwise need to gather a lunch menu for certain kids each day. (Every little bit of extra stress we take off their plates is worth it - Teaching Jobs are extremely overloaded!).

Most of the meals are ok - nothing I've ever had major issues with, and fairly healthy with the odd treat meal like Pizza and chips thrown in every now and then - but my kids still prefer to have a packed lunch most of the time to the school dinners (mainly because they are really hungry kids and get far more in a packed lunch than they do in a school meal - and before anyone rude comments none of my boys are overweight, they have always been bang on weight for height, they are just growing boys and do a lot of sport so need a lot to eat). It would be a shame for this to be rolled out for all primary ages and then largely be unused by parents - would that money then just be surplus? Seems a shame when there is a lot more in education that could use the cash - such as support for kids with special needs in schools, or even just for basic equipment to use in lessons (and those that really need the meals are in receipt of them anyway). Maybe making it more thorougly means tested might be the answer - when I was younger you could only get FSM if you were on income support or equivalent, but there are plenty of working families on low incomes that could use the help - deciding eligibility through receipt of a particular benefit is the problem I think. My oldest confessed to me that he had been sharing his packed lunch with a boy in his class since he started P4 as his parents cannot afford the school meal ( .75 a day) and also cannot afford to give him much more than a sandwich in his packed lunch, I know his mum is a single parent who works but just struggles to make ends meet.

These kids already plenty of issues to handle, its good to give them one less. 3 Even attentive parents can have some unprepared days, where they just throw in junk food for their kids to eat. This will ensure that doesn't happen. 4) ) Making it free will ensure more parent really on it. With a larger number of children having school meals it will be easier to guarantee a good menu, it will also tak some pressure off Teacher and LSA's who would otherwise need to gather a lunch menu for certain kids each day. (Every little bit of extra stress we take off their plates is worth it - Teaching Jobs are extremely overloaded!). 5) One more reason, that is not as insignificant as it sounds Doing blankett free meals for all, means less paperwork for schools, they wont have to fill in forms claiming the money back from government.

The full report on the 2012 study is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/184047/DFE-RR227.pdf From P150-151 ""The universal pilot approach cost .1 million in Newham and .6 million in Durham, equivalent to around per primary school pupil per year. Of this, 32 per cent in Newham and 46 per cent in Durham was deadweight cost (that is, involved paying for meals that would otherwise have been paid for by parents). Other initiatives targeting similar outcomes, such as the Jamie Oliver \'Feed Me Better\' campaign, appeared to be able to deliver significant impacts at substantially lower cost.""'",b'Lee Tay',2017-04-06 09:16:51,0

Some may be falling through the net, so extend the system if necessary but to give all kids free school meals is a waste of already precious few resources. Also, some dinner ladies have commented that there is no knowing who the free school meal kids are because of how the system is operated these days so that seems like a poor excuse.

Remember also that their will be many places worse off than where you live now. There are certainly alot of things with education that need improvement, but the benefits to this scheme are still important: 1) Even working and middle class families struggle from time to time, when that happens, this is one less thing for them to worry about - Their child will always get at least one good meal a day. 2) Yes we have free meals for poor families, but this seperates them from other children, and may have a stigma attatched to it or even become an excuse for bullying. These kids already plenty of issues to handle, its good to give them one less. 3 Even attentive parents can have some unprepared days, where they just throw in junk food for their kids to eat. This will ensure that doesn't happen. 4) ) Making it free will ensure more parent really on it. With a larger number of children having school meals it will be easier to guarantee a good menu, it will also tak some pressure off Teacher and LSA's who would otherwise need to gather a lunch menu for certain kids each day. (Every little bit of extra stress we take off their plates is worth it - Teaching Jobs are extremely overloaded!). 5) One more reason, that is not as insignificant as it sounds Doing blankett free meals for all, means less paperwork for schools, they wont have to fill in forms claiming the money back from government. (something that will change constantly as children come and go, and families circumstances change). 6) Some parents need FSM but they don't know that they can get it, others are scared to apply, or too stressed or even unable to read the forms - this circumvents all these problems.""",b'Bradley Manning',2017-04-06 11:32:53,0

That means, a Zero % tax hike just to afford feeding our kids! Worth it I think. Some more reasons why this is a good idea: 1) Even working and middle class families struggle from time to time, when that happens, this is one less thing for them to worry about - Their child will always get at least one good meal a day. 2) Yes we have free meals for poor families, but this seperates them from other children, and may have a stigma attatched to it or even become an excuse for bullying. These kids already plenty of issues to handle, its good to give them one less. 3 Even attentive parents can have some unprepared days, where they just throw in junk food for their kids to eat. This will ensure that doesn't happen. 4) ) Making it free will ensure more parent really on it. With a larger number of children having school meals it will be easier to guarantee a good menu, it will also tak some pressure off Teacher and LSA's who would otherwise need to gather a lunch menu for certain kids each day. (Every little bit of extra stress we take off their plates is worth it - Teaching Jobs are extremely overloaded!). 5) One more reason, that is not as insignificant as it sounds Doing blankett free meals for all, means less paperwork for schools, they wont have to fill in forms claiming the money back from government.

Also Labour have been fighting for education and teachers, so many time Labour has raked May over the coals for the poor state of academies, and underfunding public shools, last year when cameron tried to shut down ALL public schools, Labour along with parents, teachers put a stop to it. And this year, when May announced her cuts to public schools to fund her pet project, she was not given a free pass, Jeremy laid into her for that too. We have the right Labour government for our times. They have the right policies and are the right alternative for a corrupt neoliberlistic ideology, that has gone too far. And if you think Jeremy\'s image in the press is the problem - think again. Whatever leader Labour had right now, would also be being vilifed by the right wing press, depending on exactly how much they oppose this government. The fact that Jeremy is mister squeaky clean, only infuruates them more, they have no real arguement they can level against him or his polices so they produce a rhetoric and keep repeating it and repeating it and repeating it until it sinks into peoples minds... that, and subjective arguements about his ""popularity"" (which They directly influence ) is they only arguement they have.

Unfortunately thats not what the Tories think, they believe there is a class war, and they seem to think they are ""winning"". Personnally I prefer to think of things like this not in terms of ""war"", the thought of attacking people, (even torie voters) sickens me. However, I do think of this in terms of making our society fairer. The people who will be paying for these meals (And If I was in their position I\'d be very happy about it), will Not be harmed by this, they will only be paying a fraction extra. However, there are many benefits to this scheme for everyone else: 1) Even working and middle class families struggle from time to time, when that happens, this is one less thing for them to worry about - Their child will always get at least one good meal a day. 2) Yes we have free meals for poor families, but this seperates them from other children, and may have a stigma attatched to it or even become an excuse for bullying. These kids already plenty of issues to handle, its good to give them one less. 3 Even attentive parents can have some unprepared days, where they just throw in junk food for their kids to eat. This will ensure that doesn\'t happen. 4) ) Making it free will ensure more parent really on it. With a larger number of children having school meals it will be easier to guarantee a good menu, it will also tak some pressure off Teacher and LSA\'s who would otherwise need to gather a lunch menu for certain kids each day. (Every little bit of extra stress we take off their plates is worth it - Teaching Jobs are extremely overloaded!). 5) One more reason, that is not as insignificant as it sounds Doing blankett free meals for all, means less paperwork for schools, they wont have to fill in forms claiming the money back from government. (something that will change constantly as children come and go, and families circumstances change).'",b'Bradley Manning',2017-04-06 09:23:12,0
