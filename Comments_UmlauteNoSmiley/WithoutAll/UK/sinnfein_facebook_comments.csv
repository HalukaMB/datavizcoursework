We have actually been paying for our water service for the past 20 years through taxation. In fact through double taxation as we now also pay a for it through our motor tax - 66% in fact goes to water. This we accepted in the assumption that it would go toward improving our water infrastructure and quality which is very poor in on many areas and undrinkable.. however, it seems this was not the case. There have been no improvements in the service or quality despite over 1.7 billion (approx) having been collected through these taxes. Three years ago the government hastily put together a company called Irish Water plc, bought millions of second hand home water meters and began installing them at our homes with the announcement that we would soon be receiving bills (charges) for our water usage and wastage from this new company notwithstanding the fact that we arealready paying twice through taxation. An EU directive they told us that Must be obeyed. It was the straw that broke the camels back as our public services are systematically being allowed to fall into complete and utter decay and despair. We are currently operating in a third world scenario regarding health services, hospital care, homelessness, evictions, food poverty (we now have food banks and soup kitchens operating throughout the country and entire families living in hotel rooms or on the streets.. the list is endless. Meanwhile our government are busy privatising and selling off our natural resources and utilities to corporations and overseas investors while selling our debts and property off to vulture funds, all the while proclaiming to the EU and anyone who will listen that we experiencing an amazing economic recovery...All lies..only on paper and imaginary figures with nothing tangible behind them. Even though they have been caught fudging the figures nothing changes. That said, the 1% of our billionaires are tripling their wealth. And so..we finally had enough. Hence the water protests which have become about so much more than that. We've found our voices again... we are waking up in our masses.

Now the easter uprising was a small band of rebels who believed in a republic, but they were a minority in the population, Republicanism was not supported. I suppose you forget that those rebels killed Irish nationalists serving in the British Army, many just think they killed 'brits'.. The easter rebellion was a failure. The British government martyred the leaders and that is where the rise of SF becomes significant for the years following. But Irish nationalists and Republicans have forgotten those Irish nationalist who were answering Ireland's political leaders and who believed they were fighting for Irish freedom and died in flanders and the western Front and in turkey, they even made those men returning at the end of the war lepars in their own homes..

Also citizen\'s outside of the EU do not have free or reduced cost access to the vast education system or health system across Europe. I would say there is a big difference between being in and being out of the EU for Britain\'s as it\'s right on our door step.We couldn\'t travel freely across Europe before we were in the EU you could only stay in Greece for 6 months and you needed a visa to work. The only work you could get was seasonal as Greece wasn\'t part of the EU in the early 80\'s. Yes you may gain limited work but it will not be of a high standard of work. The opportunities will only be accessible after Brexit for the Elitists. You cannot just turn up in America or Australia and have free movement there is no special agreement and their healthcare costs are astronomical. You find\' t have access to the E111 either before we joined the EU. We are not part of the Schengen agreement and have always controlled our boarders so I never understood that argument ""Taking back control of our boarders"" in the Brexit campaigns. The difference is before we joined the EU we could travel, but only the wealthy who could afford to, there was an increase in travelling abroad after we joined the EU as people could then afford to as their disposable incomes increased due to the reduction in food costs which came about by joining the EU in the first place.

The uk infrastructure is bursting and the EU wouldn't make simple changes to give workable solutions to these problems. I'm not sure how much prices will in fact go up. If Europe don't want to make a deal with us it will hit them more than the UK.

Their way is just as it was in the 1600s. English Lords stealing our lands and attempting to wipe out our cultures. Being subservient to them is their only goal. Rape the poor to top up the coffers of the rich and the privileged ruling classes. Brexit is all about the protection of the City of London. To secure the Etonian boys future working in the city financial markets and securing the Privileged Classes in entering the Westminster Parliament. In the democratic system where first past the post will never change and those who live in the South East choosing the government of the day. We, the rest of us are merely cannon fodder. Everybody in the so called nation of equal partnerships have had no say and even when we tried, we were ignored anyway. The time has come to get these Tory boys and girls and drag their pig snouts from the gravy train paid for on the backs of the working classes. Scotland will be subservient to these people no more. Join us Jerry and use your political will along with the people of a free Ireland and give notice of your intention to leave the so called United Kingdom. How much more harm do these Tories have to do to your Island before you all small the coffee. Or do you like living in the 1600s being RULED by the Lords, Barons, Sheriff's and Royalty. Do not expect help from the established media either, especially the BBC. Remember the bosses of that organisation are appointed by the Tory government.

While I am happy to have such a strong Irish bloodline, I was even more lucky to have parents who encouraged me to study and gain a good education in a family environment which was totally free from any religious bias or stupid and pointless sectarian bigotry.

When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.The Covenant of the Redeemer20 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.21 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.""",b'Gareth Herron',2017-03-24 04:26:34,1

Loyalists and the British were born into privilege and made sure that privilege was maintained for their offspring. For example, the Loyalist farmer always got top price for his milk, it was always rated as high cream content. In contrast, the republican farmer always got the lowest price for his milk, always rated the lowest possible, the actual quality of the milk had no bearing on the price.When Catholics or Republicans were employed in hospitals as nurses. After they qualified they were fired. That way, no republicans were able to get into a managerial position which was reserved for the Loyalists. Manny professional republicans eventually emigrated, I know many of them in Australia. Same story with Harland and Wolff shipbuilding yards, it was all controlled by Loyalists. All this discrimination led to the Loyalists being much more wealthy than the Republicans and they controlled the economy.Police and all the civil service were tightly controlled by the loyalists, it was an undeclared apartheid system.To be registered on the electoral roll, you could only do so if you were a property owner and of course with the imbalance of wealth, there was also a great imbalance in the ratio to Republican voters compared to the general population.What the Unionists could not contrive with electoral role, they used gerrymandering to add the final touches.Usually Stormont was composed of 11 unionists and one republican and in a community that was about 60% Unionists to about 40% Republican.The British army could not defeat the IRA which militarily was irrelevant compared to the might of the British Army. That is because the IRA was necessary for the people, the IRA lived in the songs, in the pubs, in the hearts of good decent people such as grandmothers and grandfathers that had for years seen them discriminated against and nobody seemed to care.Now the IRA was fighting back and admired by the normal Catholics and republicans whose only wish was to be treated fairly in their own Country. The republicans and Catholics were second class citizens in their own country and presided over by a people that did not identify with Ireland, they did not want to be called Irish but called themselves British.Yes, they were the ones the IRA stood up to and the rank and file republicans thought, finally, someone is on our side.Whilst I regret the fact that the Republicans had to fight and kill people to effect change, I make no apologies for the mistakes, when you are fighting a civil war and treated like a criminal by the ruling elite, it\'s very difficult to operate. The real mistake was made by the British, they should have stayed home.Martin McGuinness was born into the epicentre of this discrimination and was admired and revered by the victims of this discrimination.It\'s okay for those born and raised into the privilege of a one person, one vote system to condemn Martin McGuinness and/or the IRA for their actions at the time I say the following.""You don\'t know how you would have behaved in the same circumstances.I think I would have been killed long ago.What we do know is that Republicans in Northern Ireland have a much better life these days largely due to the struggles of Martin McGuinness and others like him in the IRA.'",b'Noel Tobin',2017-03-25 04:26:17,1
