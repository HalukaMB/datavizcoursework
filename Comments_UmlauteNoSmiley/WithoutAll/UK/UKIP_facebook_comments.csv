Judged by Iraqi Judges in a Court of law and found guilty of crimes against the Iraqi people and sentenced to death by hanging. And The Sentenced Was Carried Out By Iraqis and not the American military unlike the end of World War 2. We have brought democracy to Iraq and it's people. The women have voted and expressed themselves in their elections. While their new government is far from perfect, it is a far better new system of government than what they had under Saddamm . The Surge had succeeded under George W..Bush. it was the decrease in forces under Obama that led to disastrous policy's. While the region is not completely stable ,it is a viable situation that can lead to success in the long term provided we don't abandon Iraq prematurely.

And then bomb them. So the West intervened then to stop him. In Syria the people stood up to oust Assad and he started killing them too.. But what happened then created the vacuum into which the Jihadis and Daesh stepped. And that was that the liberal hand wringers of the labour party, and liberal democrats would not let our country bomb assads military capability to prevent him killing civilians. So Obama pulled out along with the EU contingent. So when Assad started his slaughter in earnest. The Jihadi groups took advantage.. So you lot talking about keeping our noses out are twisting the events a little. It was the NON INTERVENTION which created the situation where the nut jobs took advantage. Mel Spittle needs to do a bit of research. There would have been NONE of these refugees if at that time the UN and the West had intervened as they should have. It was done properly in the Balkans. But no that did not happen. It is precisely because of liberal hand wringers not allowing troops from Europe to go in to stabilise Libya that the Jihadis took hold.. The west acted to prevent the dictators using their tanks and bombers to kill. But stopped short. They all looked to Iraq and did not learn one lesson from it. That you have to intervene but instead of doing it the way the yanks did it. You plan for it, you make sure that their police and armed forces are retained. Not like they did in Iraq just disband everything. The liberals and labour did not want to commit troops in fear of casualties. Because they did not have a clue what happened in Iraq and they believed their own appeasing bullcrap. And now with the Mel Spittles Spew the same garbage. When you get tyrants in the world. History tells us that if you do not put a stop to them immediately. Then the job of getting rid of them is not only harder. But way way more costly in lives. And what have we seen.

Remember how in their ignorance they delighted in the fact that the economy hadn\'t been destroyed in the first 90 days? That\'s the thing about an economy, it\'s a bit like a table top supported by several legs. You can take away one of the legs and it\'ll still stand up, like it has for the last 9 months after losing 17% of the value of the GBP... it takes time for that to damage the economy. There are various sectors that change at different speeds. So where are we 9 months in? Well 3 of the four legs holding up our economy are nearly completely broken and we haven\'t even left yet! According to the Office of National Statistics... things don\'t look great out there. Worries that the UK economy is losing steam have been strengthened by news of a housing market slowdown, a drop in industrial output and the weakest performance for a year by the construction industry. Economists on Friday said there was growing evidence that the UK economy slipped down a gear as it entered the new year. Economic indicators point to strains on companies from higher costs as the pound\'s slump makes imported materials and fuels more expensive. Consumers, the main driving force of UK economic growth, are also under pressure from rising inflation, with signs they are becoming less willing to spend in shops, restaurants and bars. ""A key component of the slowdown just announced from the ONS has been relatively weak retail sales in the first two months of this year. Consumption is expected to moderate further this year as increasing inflation erodes households\' purchasing power,"" But exports will be brilliant said the Brexiteers because they are cheaper with a devalued currency and yet the trade gap widened in the last quarter because we import more than we export and it is all more expensive for the UK to buy anything from anywhere in the world. So back to those legs under the table... Industrial Production Down. Construction Down. Retail Down. Manufacturing output Down. Currency Down. Housing Down. Job creation Down. Interest rates Down. Wages Down .... just because inflation is going UP this is not a good thing! But hey, I\'m just ""talking the country down aren\'t I?"" .... if that is the case then why don\'t Brexiteers just talk it back up again?

No-one expects it to solve ALL our problems, but it will help improve the lives of many. We could have been using this money to build NHS hospitals and state owned schools instead of forcing so many to agree to PFI contracts that are proving so expensive. I was watching in disbelief as the PM visited a school in Jordan that had received funding by the UK - unbelievable when my own son received no support from his schools for his dyslexia as they refused to get him assessed even after years of me requesting it. It was 100% because they did not have the finances available, as once it was confirmed they would have to provide the support. I ended up paying privately to have him assessed. Annoying to hear we are educating so many around the world yet neglecting our own kids. You can't blame the Tories for the financial mess left by Labour either.

How come Oxfam haven't, in the intervening 53 years, made themselves redundant? Surely the aim of most charities should be to solve the problem (that they were created to tackle) and therefore, make themselves redundant? The reason they haven't is because aid has become a self serving industry. The people who benefit from the aid industry are the white, middle class Guardian readers employed within it. The Libdems who want us to throw aid at Africa are the same Libdems who want to restrict African exports to the UK by keeping us in the protectionist EU. We buggered our former colonies' economies right up when we joined the EEC. At least the Empire invested in infrastructure: the aid programme just keeps Africa dependent on aid and intentionally so.""",b'Sally Stracey',2017-04-09 07:46:27,6

Aid is undoubtedly in our national interest.Overseas aid is also undoubtedly controversial; it has to be. If I am spending British taxpayers\' money on helping the people of Bangladesh who live on the chars to deal with climate change and flooding, it is clearly not available to deal with flood defences in Durham, York or elsewhere. However, I put it this way: we have pledged to spend 0.7% of our national income on international development, which means that we have 99.3% to spend on ourselves. I do not know anyone who spends 99.3% of their income on themselves; I am not sure I want to know such a person, and I am not so sure that they would have any friends. That is equally true of a nation. What influence would we have in the world, and how could we carry our heads high, if that were the case, and we were to abandon this important pledge? It is important to focus what we spend, rigorously demanding value for money, and ensuring that we have the systems to secure that and to drive down costs, so that we get proper value. [ ] The reality is that over the past five years, we have delivered education for 11 million schoolchildren; 69 million people have received financial assistance and services to trade their way out of poverty; 29 million people have benefited from our nutrition programmes; 5 million people, as my hon. Friend the Member for St Austell and Newquay (Steve Double) said, have benefited from having healthcare professionals attend at birth; 63 million people have had access to clean water; 15 million people have been able to cope with climate change; 44 million children have been immunised; and we have delivered emergency care to 13 million people in the wake of 33 disasters. That is a measure of the importance of what we are doing."" http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN03714/SN03714.pdf'",b'Mike Minns',2017-04-10 05:28:08,1

Her letter this week steps back from this notion, but only a pace. To revert to trading with the EU only on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms would cause serious harm to Britain\'s economy. It would mean the EU imposing tariffs plus a full panoply of non-tariff barriers on almost half Britain\'s exports. No big country trades with the EU only on WTO terms. An acrimonious break-up would make it harder to co-operate in such areas as foreign policy and defence. And it would surely increase the risk of Brexit triggering Scotland\'s exit from the United Kingdom. Mrs May needs not merely to soften her tone, as she has started to do this week, but to lower expectations. Instead of threatening to undercut her European partners by building an unregulated Singapore-on-Thames (something that, despite its appeal to free-traders, would horrify most Brexit voters), or hinting that Britain might co-operate less fully on security, or claiming that the EU needs Britain more than the other way round, she should accept that in these negotiations she holds the weaker hand. She should hence be more flexible over payments into the EU budget, a subject her letter skates over."" - Economist.'",b'Andy Sherwood',2017-04-09 02:16:10,0

Remember how in their ignorance they delighted in the fact that the economy hadn\'t been destroyed in the first 90 days? That\'s the thing about an economy, it\'s a bit like a table top supported by several legs. You can take away one of the legs and it\'ll still stand up, like it has for the last 9 months after losing 17% of the value of the GBP... it takes time for that to damage the economy. There are various sectors that change at different speeds. So where are we 9 months in? Well 3 of the four legs holding up our economy are nearly completely broken and we haven\'t even left yet! According to the Office of National Statistics... things don\'t look great out there. Worries that the UK economy is losing steam have been strengthened by news of a housing market slowdown, a drop in industrial output and the weakest performance for a year by the construction industry. Economists on Friday said there was growing evidence that the UK economy slipped down a gear as it entered the new year. Economic indicators point to strains on companies from higher costs as the pound\'s slump makes imported materials and fuels more expensive. Consumers, the main driving force of UK economic growth, are also under pressure from rising inflation, with signs they are becoming less willing to spend in shops, restaurants and bars. ""A key component of the slowdown just announced from the ONS has been relatively weak retail sales in the first two months of this year. Consumption is expected to moderate further this year as increasing inflation erodes households\' purchasing power,"" But exports will be brilliant said the Brexiteers because they are cheaper with a devalued currency and yet the trade gap widened in the last quarter because we import more than we export and it is all more expensive for the UK to buy anything from anywhere in the world. So back to those legs under the table... Industrial Production Down. Construction Down. Retail Down. Manufacturing output Down. Currency Down. Housing Down. Job creation Down. Interest rates Down. Wages Down .... just because inflation is going UP this is not a good thing! But hey, I\'m just ""talking the country down aren\'t I?"" .... if that is the case then why don\'t Brexiteers just talk it back up again?

They also reported that in 2016 alone, Syrian government forces delivered 12,958 barrel bombs; like Chlorine gas and Sarin nerve agent gas, these bombs are illegal under the Geneva convention.

Syrian rebels in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta have admitted to Associated Press correspondent Dale Gavlak that they were responsible for last week\'s chemical weapons incident which western powers have blamed on Bashar Al-Assad\'s forces, revealing that the casualties were the result of an accident caused by rebels mishandling chemical weapons provided to them by Saudi Arabia. ""From numerous interviews with doctors, Ghouta residents, rebel fighters and their families .many believe that certain rebels received chemical weapons via the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, and were responsible for carrying out the (deadly) gas attack,"" writes Gavlak. (back up version here). Rebels told Gavlak that they were not properly trained on how to handle the chemical weapons or even told what they were. It appears as though the weapons were initially supposed to be given to the Al-Qaeda offshoot Jabhat al-Nusra. ""We were very curious about these arms. And unfortunately, some of the fighters handled the weapons improperly and set off the explosions,"" one militant named \'J\' told Gavlak. His claims are echoed by another female fighter named \'K\', who told Gavlak, ""They didn\'t tell us what these arms were or how to use them. We didn\'t know they were chemical weapons. We never imagined they were chemical weapons."" Abu Abdel-Moneim, the father of an opposition rebel, also told Gavlak, ""My son came to me two weeks ago asking what I thought the weapons were that he had been asked to carry,"" describing them as having a ""tube-like structure"" while others were like a ""huge gas bottle."" The father names the Saudi militant who provided the weapons as Abu Ayesha. According to Abdel-Moneim, the weapons exploded inside a tunnel, killing 12 rebels. ""More than a dozen rebels interviewed reported that their salaries came from the Saudi government,"" writes Gavlak. If accurate, this story could completely derail the United States\' rush to attack Syria which has been founded on the ""undeniable"" justification that Assad was behind the chemical weapons attack. Dale Gavlak\'s credibility is very impressive. He has been a Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press for two decades and has also worked for National Public Radio (NPR) and written articles for BBC News. The website on which the story originally appeared Mint Press (which is currently down as a result of huge traffic it is attracting to the article) is a legitimate media organization based in Minnesota. The Minnesota Post did a profile on them last year. Saudi Arabia\'s alleged role in providing rebels, whom they have vehemently backed at every turn, with chemical weapons, is no surprise given the revelations earlier this week that the Saudis threatened Russia with terror attacks at next year\'s Winter Olympics in Sochi unless they abandoned support for the Syrian President. ""I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us,"" Prince Bandar allegedly told Vladimir Putin, the Telegraph reports. The Obama administration is set to present its intelligence findings today in an effort prove that Assad\'s forces were behind last week\'s attack, despite American officials admitting to the New York Times that there is no ""smoking gun"" that directly links President Assad to the attack. US intelligence officials also told the Associated Press that the intelligence proving Assad\'s culpability is ""no slam dunk."" As we reported earlier this week, intercepted intelligence revealed that the Syrian Defense Ministry was making ""panicked"" phone calls to Syria\'s chemical weapons department demanding answers in the hours after the attack, suggesting that it was not ordered by Assad\'s forces. UPDATE: Associated Press contacted us to confirm that Dale Gavlak is an AP correspondent, but that her story was not published under the banner of the Associated Press. We didn\'t claim this was the case, we merely pointed to Gavlak\'s credentials to stress that she is a credible source, being not only an AP correspondent, but also having written for PBS, BBC and Salon.com.

They also reported that in 2016 alone, Syrian government forces delivered 12,958 barrel bombs; like Chlorine gas and Sarin nerve agent gas, these bombs are illegal under the Geneva convention.

These ten pledges set out the framework for what Labour will campaign for - and what a Labour government will do. Working Together for Real Change 1. FULL EMPLOYMENT We will create a million good quality jobs across our regions and nations, and guarantee a decent job for all. By investing billion in infrastructure and industry backed up by a publicly-owned National Investment Bank and regional banks we will build a high skilled, high tech, low carbon economy to ensure that no one and no community is left behind. We will invest in the high speed broadband, energy, transport and homes that our country needs and allow good businesses to thrive, and support a new generation of co-operative enterprises. 2. A SECURE HOMES GUARANTEE We will build over a million new homes in five years, with at least half a million council homes, through our public investment strategy. We will end insecurity for private renters by introducing rent controls, secure tenancies and a charter of private tenants' rights, and increase access to affordable home ownership. 3. SECURITY AT WORK We will give people stronger employment rights from day one in a job, end exploitative zero hours contracts and create new sectoral collective bargaining rights. We will strengthen working people's representation at work and the ability of trade unions to organise, so that working people have a real voice at work. And we will put the defence of social and employment rights, as well as action against undercutting of pay and conditions through the exploitation of migrant labour, at the centre of the Brexit negotiations agenda for a new relationship with Europe. 4. A SECURE NHS AND SOCIAL CARE We will end health service privatisation and bring services into a secure, publicly-provided NHS. We will integrate the NHS and social care for older and disabled people, funding dignity across the board, and ensure parity for mental health services. 5. A NATIONAL EDUCATION SERVICE We will build a new National Education Service, open to all throughout their lives. We will ensure there is universal childcare to give all children a good start in life, allowing greater sharing of caring responsibilities and removing barriers to women participating in the labour market. We will bring about the progressive restoration of free education for all; and guarantee quality apprenticeships and adult skills training. 6. ACTION TO SECURE OUR ENVIRONMENT We will act to protect the future of our planet, with social justice at the heart of our environmental policies, and take action to fulfil the Paris climate agreement. We will ensure a fair transition to a low-carbon economy, and drive the expansion of the green industries and jobs of the future, using our National Investment Bank to invest in public and community-owned renewable energy. We will deliver clean energy and curb energy bill rises for households energy for the 60 million, not the Big Six energy companies. We will defend and extend EU environmental protections. Working Together for Real Change 7. PUT THE PUBLIC BACK INTO OUR ECONOMY We will rebuild public services and expand democratic participation, put the public back into our economy, give people a real say in their local communities with increased local and regional democracy. We will act to 'insource' our public and local council services, increase access to leisure, arts and sports across the country, and expand our publicly- controlled bus network. We will bring our railways into public ownership and extend democratic social control over our energy. 8. CUT INEQUALITY IN INCOME AND WEALTH We will build a progressive tax system so that wealth and the highest earners are fairly taxed, and shrink the gap between the highest and lowest paid. We will act to create a more equal society, boost the incomes of the poorest and close the gender pay gap. 9. ACTION TO SECURE AN EQUAL SOCIETY We will ensure that the human rights of all citizens are respected and all are protected from discrimination and prejudice. We will take action to tackle violence against women and girls, racism and discrimination on the basis of faith, and secure real equality for LGBT and disabled people. We will defend the Human Rights Act and guarantee full rights for EU citizens living and working in Britain and not allow them to be used as pawns in Brexit negotiations. 10. PEACE AND JUSTICE AT THE HEART OF FOREIGN POLICY We will put conflict resolution and human rights at the heart of foreign policy, commit to working through the United Nations, end support for aggressive wars of intervention and back effective action to alleviate the refugee crisis. We will build human rights and social justice into trade policy, honour our international treaty obligations on nuclear disarmament and encourage others to do the same.""",b'Ham Healey',2017-04-10 04:05:44,0

This of course is the opposite of the result the USA wanted !!! Meanwhile Russia is seriously pissed off, and released the following statement, ( abridged )... ""Obviously, the strike by American cruise missiles was prepared in advance. It is clear to any specialist that the decision to strike was taken in Washington before the events in Idlib, which were simply used as a pretext for demonstrating strength. The Russian side suspends the Memorandum on the Prevention of Incidents and Ensuring the Safety of Aviation Operations during Operations in Syria with the United States.

Of course the other reason is most of them are on the take, paid for partly by British billions. But Britain didn't have fascism, communism, military dictatorship so it's not surprising that despite an overwhelmingly pro EU political elite, establishment, big business, the malevolent lobbying and state apparatus network there were just enough intelligent British people left to vote to leave before the inevitable collapse.

Since the referendum, the value of the GBP has fallen by over 17%, or approximately one full days income has been lost for those on the smallest incomes. I guess that means that they can eat for just 6 days a week then and go hungry for 52 days per year? With retailers and supermarkets either increasing prices, or shrinking product size right now as a result of the increased cost of Brexit, electricity and gas bills set to increase by 7% from this month, and inflation expected to top 3% by the end of the year, interest rate hikes cannot be far behind - when interest rates go up, so do mortgages and when mortgages go up landlords put up rents to their tenants. So, adding all this up, by my back of an envelope calculation, your average job seeker is going to lose the equivalent buying power of another 2-3 days income by the end of the year each week. That is a loss to him of over 100 days a year of the basic JSA benefit payment. What are people supposed to do for that third of a year?

In hindsight though, China bullies Taiwan and Japan all the time, yet doesn't actually do anything militarily, thanks to the heavy losses in the Korean War, and a humiliating failed attempt to annex Vietnam. We could have kept Hong Kong, and still have it today.

That treaty states that the village of Gibraltar is ceded by Spain to the crown of England to perpetuity but if England wants to give it away to a third party ( i.e. The residents of Gibraltar) Spain has the right to have it back first. Which makes Gibraltar a territory imposible to apply for independence or self governance. Therefore as the treaty contemplates the sovereignty of the territory can only be English ( British now) or Spanish. In the other hand the United Nations General Assembly have requested in several occasions that the British administrators of Gibraltar should negotiate with the Spanish government to terminate the colonial situation of Gibraltar.

Only the truth can be stated and everything must be real. We also have to trade in gold as money because it is real. Common law. Europe has imposed civil code on us which is a man made law for corporations and because corporations are fake they can't be criminally convicted. So they evade criminal law. Like tony blair has with the wars he promoted. (No capitals for tony=no respect) Products break after the guarantee. Unfair contracts and small print. Watch the lightbulb conspiracy where Dutch, German and French corporations form a cartel to make products that fail. Most of our tools now are German? Civil contracts are written in legalese, the secret language of the law society created in 1914. They use blacks law English dictionary to trick us and manipulate us into using their contracts. All protected by their trained judges, their trained solicitors in their private courts known as the magistrates. Where they operate under admirality law, law of the sea. Which is why they fly the maritime flags and ask you to stand under the seal to give them authority over you. They can not force us. We must always consent! Except you dont know what you are consenting to. So stay seated when the judge enters and ask for his oath and warrant/magistrates badge :) they will abandon court haha. Just to make you think a little. Ships and maritime law. What do you step into at court? A dock! What do they use in their legal system? Our Berth certificate. Look them up and see for yourself. It all makes sense when you see it. The law society. Another corporation within the city of London corporation which private and operates under the same European civil code which is why parliament enforces it. Just filled with lies because they are acting as a corporation and evading their oath of office to the Sovereign. You and me. Now you know why they lie and why judges have been letting people off for crimes. Look on my common ground independence party page and see Teresa May as a corporation. Look on company search on Dun & Bradstreet. You look then you shall find... They (Europe/New Nazi order) print fake currency, they control the stock markets from Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg as a way of getting the wealth home. Create debt and enslave countries and steal their resources. Remember the game monopoly. Find it's origins and you will be shocked. The bank always wins which is why the bank keeps winning today. Protected under Roman rules ;) once we are out then we can prosecute these people for crimes and get our wealth back they have stolen. All you have to do is this. Watch 1.Four Horsemen 2.John Harris it's an illusion 2 3.Mike malloney hidden secrets of money 4.RSA animate changing education paradigm by Sir Ken Robbinson 5.Queen Elizabeth II not rightful heir to the throne Tony Robinson. 6.Thrive 7.Beat mortgage eviction bailiffs 8.Face to face with Dean Clifford Capitalism and the Dutch East India Company | Crash Course World History Join host John Green to learn about the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, doing business as the VOC, also known as the Dutch East India Company. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Dutch managed to dominate world trade, and they did so through the pioneering use of corporations and finance. However, not all of their ways were new; traditional methods such as violently enforced monopolies, unfair trade agreements, and warfare The reason we need out of Europe is to remove these contracts and manipulation from our country so we can go back to normal. This is why we are in this mess and we need to cut all ties and start again with our contracts. Which is just a format of truth and not a contract of demands. One demand. THE TRUTH!!! No more lies. No more big corporations who evade law with high judicial fees. Government who swears an oath to the people. Police to serve and protect. NHS in prime condition. Trade in real gold to eliminate private banks, government corruption and the silently stealing of our wealth. We get to see the accounting of our country. Our budget. We bring back the rule of law and with that comes trust, integrity and the rewarding of good practice vs bad. We would restore everything, not just in the UK but all over the common wealth. Half the globe! No more offshore accounting. Everyone cared for. No more debt or debt slavery. No more policies to have Britain scraping the barrel when we have invented nearly everything in this modern world. We are about to make history. It depends if you are supporting the good guys or the bad ones. That choice is yours. I am just providing you with the other side of the story no one wants to tell you. Now the responsibility lies with you to make a choice based on facts presented backed by physical evidence :) https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1319595948124613&id=1204306359653573""",b'Michael Jarratt',2017-04-05 05:43:06,0

The Bible as a book is actually more violent than the Quran, and none of us would have declared the KKK peaceful. The majority of Muslims condemn this violence, so even if it is built into the religion it is not necessarily practiced, except it clearly is, as Roger points out, but a lot of the instability is linked to the West invading, and if we responded violently (which we unfortnately do), doesn't that make us just as bad?

Islam is a wide array of moral and cosmological propositions, the majority of which are not conducive to human wellbeing and those that are are not exclusive to the faith. Muslims are people who accept some of these propositions. I mean, Islam makes it incumbent upon Muslims to kill Jews on sight, but the simple fact that the vast majority of Muslims don\'t do this proves the vast majority of Muslims only accept certain ideas found within Islam to be true.

Discord in the Middle East can undoubtedbly catalyse violence through the lens of Islamic terrorism, but it isn\'t the only answer. Many Muslims who commit terror offences or hold Islamist views have never been to the Middle East in their lives. Indeed, the most ""hardline"" demographic of Muslims in the west are 18-24 year olds, followed by 24 - 30 years - most of who have never set foot in Asia in their lives. Secondly, yes, the Bible is also violent and the KKK are nutjobs. But that is a separate issue. We\'re talking about Islam here, not Christianity. We can\'t keep comparing everything to the extremely low bar that Christianity sets because a) it\'s pointless and gives a low target to aim for (we can do better) and b) you can\'t have an interesting discussion about problems uniquely pertaining to Islam if somebody is trying to derail the conversation by issuing criticisms of Christianity. I agree that this is also a conversation that needs to be had, but it\'s a separate conversation. You also seem to think that there\'s a West vs Islam/Muslim dichotomy here. Not true. The overwhelming majority of the victims of Islam terrorism and cultural jihad are Muslims themselves. Besides, Western actions in the Middle East haven\'t always been bad. Sometimes they have been severely misguided and have made things worse. But, for example, the people of Iraq had been petitioning the US to save them from the scourge of Saddam Hussein for over 10 years before the Anfal campaign, an assault on the citizens of Iraq with chemical weapons by Hussein, inspired them into action. Again, I never suggested punishing all of them. I never suggested deporting all of them. I didn\'t suggest this for one. This is a fantasy you have created, because these are not my views and they aren\'t the views of anybody I\'ve heard speak about this issue.

When the angel Gabriel came to muhammad the angel told him to write down the recitation he would relate to him. The angel said that what he was going to recite were the words of god and as such could not be altered. Herein lies the problem. Of the three great monotheistic religions, islam is the youngest. The qur'an and whoever wrote it plagiarised both the torah and the bible. There are many sura's and verses exhorting death to non-believers. And much more, I've heard, in the hadith.

Sadly you are probably right about there being less refugees as we refuse to let them in. I feel the word flooded is a little overdramatic given less than 5% of the UK is Muslim, and that includes people who have lived here for generations. But nonetheless that is a significant amount, and so needs dealing with, but multiculturalism is a solution, not a problem...what you have described is the opposite. We should put more effort into encouraging integration, as most people who come want to be part of society, it benefits everyone. I think you're right about not being able to criticise, but I think that's starting to change since Brexit, we just have to be careful it's criticism as opposed to abuse. I personally don't have a problem with immigration (but that's a different story), but understand if people do and reducing immigration is a reasonable thing to want, but it shouldn't include racial discrimination, or kicking people out who've lived and made their lives here. Also remember these people aren't coming from luxury, even if they are coming for economic reasons most don't want to come and live solely off benefits...it's hardly the life of riley, and they come because of desperate economic situations back home, what else can they do? Our economic situation is far more due to austerity and big businesses taking advantage of workers than it is immigration (Sorry for the super long paragraph!)""",b'Rose Wood',2017-04-04 12:06:36,0

Facism is a dangerous ideology which can be directly translated to many millions of deaths in the last century. Opposing groups who profligate surrendering their will to the state is something I\'d support. Whilst I agree those groups should be opposed and challenged and exposed however, I don\'t believe they should be silenced. After all, those ideologies are much more dangerous if allowed to fester and sit under the surface. Whilst I despise the populism of sections of UKIP including farage, I don\'t believe they should be silenced. It\'s arguably that UKIP and groups like britain first have had a positive impact on any fight against extremist political beliefs by being so comically crap and so exposed that mainstream British beliefs largely reject them. They\'ve been so awful they\'ve also led to people on the edge or ignorant of certain minorities or views to challenge their own opinions so as not to be aligned to them.'",b'Ed Waddington',2017-04-05 00:23:16,0

There\'s a difference between closing down and challenging people; If I was walking through a street and I heard someone being openly racist, nasty and vicious, or inciting hatred I\'d challenge them.

Whilst this is complicated I would say this is someone who would use the instruments of state over the individual to pursue an agenda which is ultra nationalist, that is advancing the cause of it's citizens based on their nationality, driven by creating fear of other ethnic groups, nations or people. For example britain first are a profoundly facist group as is evidenced by their manifesto. UKIP I'd class a mishmash of facists, anti federalists, libertarians and, if truth be told, idiots.

Suddenly the quota lifts and more fish are caught and sold. More fish available for restaurants and the price comes down, suddenly you have a farming issue around ethical pricing towards the produce caught and sold. Supply and demand becomes an abstract. Look at the current issues around farmers being paid fairly for produce by supermarkets (which is regularly intervened by the eu to offer financial and diplomatic support to farmers)... 2) these fishing communities, and seaside towns get a shed load of funding from the EU.

Rejecting the far Left himself when in office he led a first-timer centre right-wing Labour as a magnate to all those who admired the Tories but could not give that party their vote. He won over the middle classes, and many wealthy bosses as well as drawing the voting working class towards Labour. He had the people with him because he offered them something tangible that improved their lives. If Brexit uses the same method it will be a political success and Britain will have emulated his triumph. Onwards and upwards, vote centre, with one foot in the Labour camp and one foot in the Tory camp until we see which foot has the best leg to stand on. Now Jeremy Corbyn has to be far further Left than Blair as it is more in his own nature to be so. And Labour's true modern appeal to a restless and as yet undiscerning voting public of the poor majority. Transferring his personal preferences from self to party is proving a rocky road that many Labour voters think reflects his dereliction of duty in policies that fall short of true conviction, though on the contrary, this can be fairly assumed to be an over-pessimistic view of his political stance always made in good faith. JC's policies also show he has remarkable humanity. Like Blair, JC has said he will house the homeless. But the Police think they rely on making a man homeless to control crime; rapists cannot be brought indoors, or lunatic violent men. And there are too many of them to strictly police when accommodation always means another police call. Blair was simply told 'no' he couldn't bring them in. But a 'ban the bomb' PM would only make the enemy attack as they would know he is mad in an atomic age when terrorists are waiting to break down peace at any cost. And Labour is in the wings claiming it is using its time before the next election to formulate new policies it will present then, for post-Brexit is a wobbly uncertain future yet to be defined and attempted in no vain hope that the Tories will succeed. The British are no fool when it comes to winning through adversity with tenacity, hope, courage and national pride well in place. Labour can only be the running mate in the wings until we see exactly what it is we are dealing with, including our divorce from the EU which appears to produce more than one tactical error in its wake. Labour is playing the waiting game, but is it enhancing JC or is it denying him Labour's true image with a Leader who can in the future lead a new Britain? Blair was always new. Blair's New Labour of old now becomes Renewing Labour with its safe new Britain in a brave new world calling upon some of its old political strengths to garner for this new era. And some of JC's he can reveal to us in his own timely manner. JC can make a marriage between what we have already and where it is going to take us now. Post-Brexit will be his newborn baby and he has to show he can Father our nation. Whilst good old Theresa May is proving she is Mother Nature herself in her PM-ship she has turned into a natural role for a politician adaptable and with true genius; hers is a flawless and uncompromising rivalry as she rises to every challenge astute and aware of difficulties arising she deals with so sublimely. It is going to be a dream-like transition from EU to our going it alone and May will make many new friends for Britain to create our new economy. We can be confident of our Tory post-Brexit, a challenge JC can rise to, but can he climb over and above for Labour? The future will tell. Tony has told Jeremy 'make policy' to reflect Labour's values; Tony was great. Theresa is a natural politician who will make the transition easy. Goodbye EU.

Firstly I am a conservative (which is the other side of left wing) and you simply commenting I have a left wing mind doesn't make it true I am however not racist, I voted for brexit ( to leave the EU) because I believe it is the right choice for the uk to control its own borders as the uk is heavily populated already and controlling immigration would stop many people coming to the uk to claim what is not rightfully theirs and a few other reasons such as jobs and housing for the young adults. Secondly you just singled out a whole religion as the reason why immigration is bad for the uk are their issues with extremism in the Uk... yes, are all Muslims bad ? Well it's estimated that their are 3 million Muslims in the UK if they are all terrorist like many people claim then you would all be dead already it's the few who are extreme, that claim then want sharia law. This will never happen because the uk has its own government and own laws. If anything needs to change it's that we stop letting people immigrate who bring nothing to the uk, no money, no skills, no degree. Let the people who will actually become doctors, police, engineers, builders and other valuable jobs in and remove the benefit bludgers. """,b'Charlie J CJ',2017-04-04 01:45:50,1

Carl please do not assume anything about me or my reasons for voting to leave the EU.

Here\'s the latest available unemployment figures for those between school leaving age and 25 years old, in Europe Greece .2% Spain .9% Italy .1% Cyprus .32.8% Portugal .26.4% France . 26.2% Bulgaria .4% Belgium .. 20.4% Luxembourg .. 19.9% Sweden ..18.5% UK ..12.6% Germany .5% (the only EU country with single figure youth unemployment, surprise surprise). No stable and buoyant economy should have youth unemployment above 17.5% That is why youngsters from all over Europe are exploiting the freedom of movement act to get to the UK and take jobs that should be there for our own youngsters. When we joined the EEC (as it was then) as its 8th member in 1973, its share of world economic output was 31%. It has added 20 more members since then to see that share diminish to a mere 16.5% pretty smart that, add 20 members in order to see your share of world economic output almost halved; a quick look at some of the lame ducks given membership ( .1 billion)and 7 other members make net annual contributions, while the other 20 receive net subsidies !! (Luxembourg being the biggest beneficiary another glass of Jean Claude Junker .. The Italian banks are on their knees coughing up blood, a quick look at the economies of EU member states reveal terminal illness everywhere. The EU, and in particular, the Euro, has destroyed Greece, decimated the economies of Spain, Italy, and Portugal, with the main beneficiaries being Germany and France, so why anyone visualises this insular protectionist union as some sort of economic utopia is quite staggering. When I voted to join in 1973, I was voting to join a common market, not a political union that has been heading like a runaway train towards a single government federal state. This fact was hidden from the public by the treacherous Ted Heath and his government until it was revealed in 2001 under the 30 year disclosure law, which detailed the reaction of himself and his government to the ""Werner"" report. It was also revealed that Geoffrey Rippon said to Ted Heath at the time ""If we want to join the EEC, we will have to sacrifice the British fishing industry"" which is exactly what the traitor did, reducing our fishing protection zone from 200 nautical miles to 12, devastating hundreds of communities and bringing the largest fishing industry in Europe to its knees; and it affected the whole country; before this, every high street in the country and every secondary shopping parade boasted at least one fishmonger supplying delicious, cheap healthy food for the whole country from the bountiful stocks of the North Sea (you\'re old enough to remember that, as am I) Apologies for a lengthy reply, but my reasons for wanting to leave are many and carefully considered , there are more, many more, but you may be asleep by now PEACE'",b'Alan Bryan',2017-04-03 04:39:42,2

An Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltar from Spain in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of the Habsburg claim to the Spanish throne. The territory was subsequently ceded to Great Britain ""in perpetuity"" under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Regarding Hong Kong, it was on lease to us as follows....In 1898, the British and Chinese governments signed the Second Convention of Peking, which included a 99-year lease agreement for the islands surrounding Hong Kong, called the ""New Territories."" The lease awarded control of more than 200 surrounding small islands to the British. In return, China got a promise that the islands would be returned to it after 99 years.

That is a shame, and is clouding the discussion on sovereignty, democracy, public services, taxation, the environment. I'm not here to get a rise out of UKIP supporters, but to see if I can understand what a good Brexit will look like. How do we get good trade deals for our goods and services? How does the perilous future of oil impact on our thinking about production and transporting of goods? European countries are our closest neighbours - it makes sense in all ways to have good trading relationship with them.

How would you represent the interests, in actual practical terms, of businesses who currently trade mostly in Europe, or who import from Europe?""",b'Sara Haworth',2017-03-31 06:49:57,1

They need the UK market more than ever before - All we need to do is ask the EU Masters - i.e. Germany a very simple question. What are they going to do with the 820,000 cars (20% of your production) and the billions of pounds worth of services and technical products (from companies such as Siemens and Bosch) if a sensible agreement cannot be reached? German, French and Italian companies are currently shaking in their boots wondering what the hell this will mean for their future - we will get a decent agreement - they simply cannot afford not to.
