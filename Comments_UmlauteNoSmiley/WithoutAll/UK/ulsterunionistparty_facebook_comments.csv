They would love to see the UUP as the largest Unionist party, as it would be a concession a day to the IRA. If the UUP is serious about doing things that are best for Northern Ireland, disband, and join as a single Unionist party.'",b'Rab Jervis',2017-02-28 17:32:26,0

Your decision along with the vote in favour by one of your MLA's handed a propaganda victory to the same sex marriage lobby. Your lack of leadership almost led to a change in the definition of Biblical marriage. Marriage is a Divine institution not to be tampered with by man. As such, I cannot in good conscience, vote for any candidate or party that would directly or indirectly open the door for its re-definition. Your action in this matter has diminished confidence that the UUP can be trusted to protect the traditional view of Biblical marriage.

This election was not about that, it was about the here and now, about RHI, accountability and competency in government. A transfer at this election to SDLP was not a vote for a united Ireland. A protest vote, a kick up the bum, whatever way you want to see it. Also for two parties who want to power share, who signed up to it. Yes it should have been handled better, hindsight and all that. I think Mike wanted to get away from the simply Union at all costs strategy of voting. As regards Sinn Feins vote. I am guessing here but it wouldn't surprise me if a sizeable percentage of their increase were in fact Catholic Unionists who don't normally vote but saw them as the best way to kick back against their perceived arrogance of Arlene and the DUP's attitude.

I do however, believe that Sinn Fein seized the opportunity of the RHI debacle, to strike a blow against Unionism. Read posts by Alex Maskey that confirm their true intentions. The problem we now face, is that Sinn Fein are emboldened by the result, and regardless of the reasons, of no doubt well intentioned people, they will use it to further their own agenda, no party is better at spin, and rewriting history. Involuntary coalition is always going to cause problems, and is in reality unworkable, until all accept your well made point that a United Ireland is a lifetime away, if there was a desire for it. I do not like to refer to religious divides etc, you certainly, as you are obviously well aware, don't have to be Protestant, to be a Unionist, or indeed a Catholic to be a Nationalist. The problem we have is that no Nationalist / Republican Party, will tell their people that a United Ireland is an unlikely prospect in their lifetime That in itself generates mistrust, in the Unionist community, which is exploited by many in the DUP etc. Until all can convince people, with sincerity, that they are working for a better NI, for all, with no underlying actions to destroy it's very existence, then we will not achieve, what, Mike Nesbitt was looking for. He was naive, in the extreme, to attempt it at this time. He took the lead, and got scant support, from his intended partner in coalition, so he was doomed to failure, and achieved nothing more than strengthening the position of Nationalists and weakening Unionism, which will make devolved decisions for the betterment of all in NI, difficult if not impossible. Sinn Fein will accelerate their agenda of eroding anything British, deepening divide which suits them, whilst Unionists continue to bicker, divide and conquer, is a tactic they are using to their advantage.""",b'John Ross',2017-03-05 11:17:35,0

Surely if Mikes plan keeps the DUP and SF from coming back as the biggest parties its worth making some hard choices? ?? Do you want the same two back- they cant work together. Ok. I admit I\'m voting Alliance but I have been posting some thought provoking comments on both the SF/ DUP facebook page, nothing negative, just asking questions, promoting ideas, alternatives They are the parties I have issues with. Of note I have been putting DUP supporters minds at rest as they seem to be obsessed with impending unification (eg one lovely sparky charismatic old lady who can use a lap top like a demon despite being 81 she stated SF number one and only priority was a united Ireland) So I was able to reply to her quoting their manifesto of which it is one vague paragraph. I reminded her that UK and RoI would have to agree and it was years away. I suggested she consider other parties if she was voting out of fear now I have assuaged her worry. Imagine my surprise, my confusion, my anger when yesterday when I went looking for her feedback I find that every single comment I had ever made on the DUP facebook was removed and I was not longer permitted to comment on their page!!!!! That in itself is pretty outrageous but what is worse is the DUP are happy to leave vile and nasty comments from nationalists about the party leader, calling her a pig, about her short hair, clothes, etc they are happy to leave comments from nationalists ""our day is coming/ SF first minister/ United Ireland"" They leave all the comments from their supporters warning not to split the unionist vote "" If you don\'t vote DUP youll get a SF first minister"" They leave nasty comments from supporters about how useless the UUP are. MY QUESTION- why leave all that negativity but remove my questions and neutral commentary? MY (SUGGESTED) ANSWER- I believe it is an extension of their manifesto a campaign built on scaring people to vote for them through fear of what might happen if they don\'t vote for them. I appreciate it is their site and their control, but surely this is censorship and control, in fact what they are leaving behind is cleverly disguised propaganda. If you know of DUP supporters who might like to open their minds please share, talk to, or encourage because this doesn\'t seem fair or right to me.

Ok. I admit I\'m voting Alliance but was so tempted with the UUP / SDLP alliance... shame SDLP didnt reciprocate Mike Nesbitts kind and brave offer....I have been posting some thought provoking comments on both the SF/ DUP facebook page, nothing negative, just asking questions, promoting ideas, alternatives They are the parties I have issues with. Of note I have been putting DUP supporters minds at rest as they seem to be obsessed with impending unification (eg one poor old lady stated SF number one and only priority was a united Ireland) So I was able to reply to her quoting their manifesto of which it is one vague paragraph. I reminded her that UK and RoI would have to agree and it was years away.(She will be long gone!) I suggested she consider other pro unions parties if she was voting out of fear now I have assuaged her worry. Imagine my surprise, my confusion, my anger when last week I went looking for her feedback I find that every single comment I had ever made on the DUP facebook was removed and I was not longer permitted to comment on their page!!!!! That in itself is pretty outrageous but what is worse is the DUP are happy to leave vile and nasty comments from nationalists about the party leader, calling her a pig, about her short hair, clothes, etc they are happy to leave comments from nationalists ""our day is coming/ SF first minister/ United Ireland"" They leave all the comments from their supporters warning not to split the unionist vote "" If you don\'t vote DUP youll get a SF first minister"" They leave nasty comments from supporters about how useless the UUP are. MY QUESTION- why leave all that negativity but remove my questions and neutral commentary? MY (SUGGESTED) ANSWER- I believe it is an extension of their manifesto a campaign built on scaring people to vote for them through fear of what might happen if they don\'t vote for them. I appreciate it is their site and their control, but surely this is censorship and control, in fact what they are leaving behind is cleverly disguised propaganda. Can their members not be trusted to consider other options? Is this North Korea or Northern Ireland? If you know of DUP supporters who might like to open their minds please share, talk to, or encourage because this doesn\'t seem fair or right to me. How do we at least talk to these people and get the debate off the ground ? A close and dear relative of mine has basically told me she is voting DUP and she told me its a ""private matter"" as to why. This has hurt me more than she will ever know. Have just noted that Arlene Foster has also blocked me and my commentaries on her page- ALL GONE. I am sorry to hijack this page but I had to get this out .'",b'Andrew Maris',2017-02-27 15:28:09,1

In many ways, I wish Northern Ireland had never been created, as Home Rule may not have been so bad (but then there was the dominance of the Catholic Church in Ireland as a whole and then the calls to arms by both ""sides"" in 1912, and then the 1916 rebellion, made the messy compromise of Northern Ireland and an Irish Free State inevitable). I\'ve just been watching Spotlight on BBC One NI, about power-sharing here and elsewhere, or lack of it. What a wasted opportunity 1974 was: Brian Faulkner, Gerry Fitt, Oliver Napier & Co, undermined by ""the Demon Doctor"" as Faulkner called him, continuing (mainly) IRA violence, and a weak British Government. 1998 is not quite wasted yet, but, on Spotlight, Bertyie Ahern admitted himself that they spent so much time talking to Sinn Fein, thus undermining the SDLP, because it was SF who had influence over the guns. David Trimble was already being undermined by continual sniping by Paisley, who only ever wanted to be top-dog, over refusal of the IRA to disarm and for republican support of the police. So we are where we are, and the two governments at the time, which had strong mandates & no excuse for weakness, must share a lot of the blame for elevating extremes, because they magnified their importance. The Union? Well, with Brexit in the mix, it\'s clearly made things messy, but, again, we are where where are. The Good Friday is in-tact. The principle of consent is in-tact. If the Union is unsafe, it is not Northern Ireland (or Irish nationalists) that are making it unsafe, it is Brexit, UKIP and possibly the SNP. I am content to have ever greater relationships between North and South and within and between these islands, Relationships build, stalemate splits and stagnates. The UUP secured the principle of consent and the abolition of Articles 2 & 3 - so I support the UUP. But my support is not unconditional - I am liberal minded and any truck with the DUP will have me opting elsewhere.'",b'Gavin Nixon',2017-02-14 18:34:07,1

What I don\'t understand is why the fixation on this particular issue. Why marriage specifically? I\'m not sure exactly which biblical references you have used to establish your conviction but I have an idea. I\'m going to give sufficient credit to you to assume that the story of Sodom and Gomorroah doesn\'t influence your viewpoint, particularly as both Ezekiel and Jesus himself clarify that the real reason for their destruction stemmed from social injustice and a lack of hospitality and the ""perversions"" described in Jude 1:7 is clearly a reference to the ill intent towards the angels. I\'ll stick with the NIV for the sake avoiding ambiguity considering there are literally hundreds of English translations of these verses and many of them bear littles resemblence to each other. Gensis 2:24 - That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh. This one is interesting because Eve was created to be, as God described, a ""helper"" to Adam. Interestingly she was also only created after God and Adam considered whether any of the beasts could also be ""helpers"" instead. That\'s pretty disconcerting? Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13 are both fairly clear in what the forbid in the NIV, so I can understand your viewpoint based on these verses. It is unfortunate that you seem to have such callous disregard for Leviticus 19:19 then. I mean, I don\'t know you personally but I can see at least two breaches of what it says in that verse in your profile picture alone. Is this a less important verse? Why is this particular portion of God\'s law less significant in your eyes? I\'m not even going to bother with a deconstrutcion of the story of David and Johnathan in 1 and 2 Samuel as I\'m sure you will tell me that ""Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women"" was some form of poetic license and David didn\'t *really* mean that. Anyway, I digress. I am curious why your main political motivation - having seen your postings here and elsewhere - appears to be the opposition of ""Marriage Equality"" when the party you are choosing to endorse to further that goal are such fat-eating (Lev 3:17), blind-eye-turning (Lev 5:1), unclean-animal-touching (Lev 5:2), neighbour deceiving (Lev 6:2), rabbit-eating(Lev 11:4-7, Lev 11:10-12), football-playing (Lev 11:8), mixed-fabric-wearing (Lev 19:19), beard-grooming (Lev 19:27), tattoo-having (Lev 19:28), foreigner-disrespecting (Lev 19:33-34), land-selling (Lev 25:23), lying (Lev 19:11), stealing (Lev 19:11) hypocrites.

As I see it the largest Unionist party has to share power with the largest Nationalist party. The UUP wants to be the largest Unionist party so it illogical to transfer votes to the DUP. I presume they would also prefer to share with the SDLP rather than SF. Ya falla. The Union is safe, in fact a United Ireland is safe. Both are written in the constitution if wanted by 75% of the people. That means that stance should not be the driving force of elections now. It also means those who say unionists should transfer to unionists and nationalists should transfer to nationalists are only interested in entrenched ideologies and not what is best for the future of every citizen of this country.

The Taggarts were poster boys of the property boom, their companies having a turnover of just 20 years after Michael Taggart bought his first plot of land. Their lavish lifestyle inspired many rumours, the juiciest (and most denied) that Lionel Richie played at Michael\'s wedding in 2007. Their businesses collapsed in the crash in 2008 when values plummeted most dramatically and three years later, a site of 96 acres which Taggarts bought with Anglo Irish Bank finance, is on Nama\'s books. But instead of being for sale, accountants in Dublin are looking for \'expressions of interest\' about the Millmount site in Dundonald. It was valued at the peak of the housing market at around per acre but it\'s estimated the current value would be no more than in total. A DoE spokesman confirmed the application was still being considered. Michael Rodgers of Rodgers and Browne Estate Agents in Holywood, Co Down, said it was surprising that the Millmount site was not being explicitly marketed for sale.

I can't speak for Loyalism as a whole, but as a young Loyalist I'm beginning to feel distant from the party I once apsired to Join and run for. My reason for distance is an issue of class. The UUP do not represent Working Class Loyalism any further than Council level. It is a growing concern of mine that the UUP are happier to shack up with Middle Class Nationalists and Unionists while forgetting about and leaving the Working Class to fend for themselves without representation.
