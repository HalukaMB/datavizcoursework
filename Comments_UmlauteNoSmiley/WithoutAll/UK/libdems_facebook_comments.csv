Those 'Leaver Deceivers' are being found out day by day, hence their desperation to not let the public have a final say. No matter, they have to try and hang on to their result for ever and some of them may well see it overturned. It's a long road without a bend and lots can happen, sooner or later it will bend our way. The true will of the British people will triumph in the end. Even if we do leave, we'll rejoin again at some point and many of us will never stop campaigning until that happens.

I have friends who voted leave who are in minimum wage jobs, no academic education. I have friends who voted remain in both circumstances as above.

It does not matter one bit. You could argue inadequacy and lack of knowledge on both sides. You could argue that whichever side is against you is wrong. Again, it does not matter. What matters here is where we are heading. I am sick to my teeth of hearing this government stirring emotions on poor people, those who are very vulnerable of being manipulated. I am sick of how they still are peddling untruths like the one referenced in the first comment on this thread: The EU is to blame for everything that has gone wrong in your life! Labourers are not poorer because we are in the EU, they are poorer because in an economic model based on financial services and driven by consumerism you need to keep all investment and subsidies in the enterprise that is making you money. Have you ever wondered why is cheaper to bring apples from Africa than it is to grow them here? I believe you immediately are going to blame some obscure idea that has come from the EU, however many other countries IN the EU manage just great to grow their own produce. We don't. The government has taken every subsidy and investment and infrastructure project and has placed it on the service industry, basically the financial services to keep them competitive, and everyone can buy our main exporting 'product'. They've not done so with other industries and no one in this country has said anything at all for many years, as we all have enjoyed the benefits of this booming economic success! We have always had sovereignty, we've always have had border control, even more so than any other EU member states, but the government is quite happy not only to allow people to believe, but to fuel this belief that the EU is responsible for all your woes and worries. The problem I see is not leaving the EU, but leaving the single market and the ECC, both of which are crucial to sustain the industry that has supported the economic model of the UK. Have you recently read on how we 'may have to' accept migration isn't going to go down for a long while? And that we 'may have to accept' that we will have to pay a lot of money to keep the parts we want? None of the issues that fueled many people to vote leave are going to be resolved, but the government has seen a great opportunity to 'white-wash' all their wrongs to strengthen their political position. That's what I find such an evil control move.""",b'Isela Bonequi',2017-04-11 00:14:46,7

It fails to mention loss of 'passporting rights ' for our finance and services sector which make up 80% of our GDP. Nor does it recognise the fact that we host many multi national companies who are based here due to our access to EU markets.The fact that our agriculture sector would be devastated by trade restrictions and loss of seasonal labour. There are many other issues which you'll start noticing being mentioned on the news soon. The reason you give for leaving is 'sovereignty '.This is bases on the lie that the EU has any sovereign powers.Mostly it regulates product and services,employment protections and environmental issues. These we will most likely stick to anyway if we wish to trade with the EU. We gain nothing effectively whilst losing a lot exotically.

You should actually do some research before you condemn the LibDems for going into power with the Conservatives. As a party we would much rather have cooperated with Labour but unfortunately Gordon Brown would not resign as PM despite losing the 2010 general election mainly due to the catastrophic mess Labour left with the economy. Also Labour and the LibDems would not have had enough seats to form a majority coalition and would have had to rely on all the other parties for backing to out vote the Tories. The LibDems went into power because they had a chance to push their own agenda and represent their members, such as me in government for the first time. Labour has no right to tell the LibDems what to do, we are a seperate independant party that can work with others. Its time you got your act together and formed a credible opposition instead of going back to left wing socialist ideology that has long since failed.

Our MP voted to pass the Article 50 Bill. He was already losing support amongst the voters for vacillating post referendum, now, hard to find a soul who still supports him. I personally cancelled my Labour membership and joined the Libdems last September, when it became obvious to me Labour (leadership and some important MPs, were now Brexiters) were going to sit on the government benches for Brexit. Also, the conservative voters I know in the area feel deeply betrayed by Brexit (and other government policies) and intend voting differently next time there\'s a chance. Moderate and centre voters in England (other nations in the U.K. have additional options of course) have no political champion now but the Libdems. You will continue to grow and thrive. The Libdems were close to Labour in my area in 2010. Not so close in 2015. But now, as the only sane party left in England committed to opposing this horrible swindle of Brexit, you stand a great chance of regaining all that was lost and more. As I\'m sure you know. My MP Chuka Umunna is a lot more vulnerable electorally than he thinks. Next GE is possibly a lot sooner than expected. In consideration of Brexit and its endless roll of lies and negative consequences, and if the CPS end up charging a bunch of Con MPs with electoral fraud. Plus, what will likely be significant gains in May for the Libdems, putting the lie to this ""will of the people"" slogan. Chuka Umunna, has voted for Brexit in parliament. He\'s essentially a UKIP MP in the opinion of many here now. I suspect you\'ve a great opportunity to unseat him and many other Labour and Conservative MP\'s who don\'t have the courage to stand up to the lies of the Brexit mob when it matters. For many millions of Conservative voters are also as betrayed as traditional Labour ones. Give a thought to a massive push in all such areas when the moment arrives! Well done on these latest results. I look forward to very many more gains next month. You will carry the support of the centre and the moderates left and right of it because the main parties have failed us and bought into an agenda of lies.

Like the mess of global warming and climate change, our generation and generations to come will be affected and left to pick up the pieces and the consequences will be felt for a very long time. But it just goes to show they campaigned for over 40 years to leave the EU, they won on a slim majority. Officially 6% of leave voters regret their decision to vote to leave the EU. The so called benefits of leaving are unraveling as lies faster and faster every day. As a result, more people are changing their minds about brexit. I've seen it myself. But saying fighting the result isn't political suicide, it wasn't for the Eurosceptics, why would it be for the Pro Europeans? Why just sit by and let such a disaster happen and do nothing about it? Could you look your generation in the eyes and say you did nothing about it? I certainly couldn't. We can't just let coincidence dictate the future of this country. If a democracy cannot change its mind, then it ceases to be a democracy. People are being made redundant because of brexit, 44 factory workers where my dad works in Nottingham are being made redundant thanks to brexit. Staff at a Wales University are being made redundant, airlines are threatening to pull out. Businesses are moving out of the UK to other EU countries, potential investment and jobs just gone like that.

I would have voted against it if I had a vote at the time. I agree that the elderly deciding the future is unfair for the rest of us. People probably do regret their vote. But let me ask you this, if you challenge the result of a democratic referendum, what precedent does that set? It sets the idea that you can challenge any result you don't like, which undermines democracy as a concept and only causes instability inside the country. It's not that I'm happy doing nothing to oppose it, it's that there's nothing that can be done. We bite this bullet.

Referendums are only meant to be used as advisory purposes only, the result isn't legally binding. We aren't ignoring voters, we're simply fighting to change opinions, just like the leavers did from the first referendum over 40 years ago. There is everything that can be done and many think so too. If you saw in London a few weeks ago 119,280 people took to the streets (more than what was expected) to protest against brexit, many people are feeling the same as I think the official figure could be even higher than 6%. Opposing and putting a stop to a suicide attempt that is brexit isn't undermining it at all. Everyday, brexit is falling apart more and more, I'm even seeing brexiters lose their appetite for it. This decision was enough to divide the country on its own. I'm sure many people feel the same then is currently showing, it's just the leave voters are bullying people into silence. They know it can be overturned, and as Nigel Farage said himself a 52-48 victory for remain would be unfinished business, but a two-thirds victory and that would be the end of it. The leave side wouldn't have stopped fighting if we had won with the same result, so why should remain stop? We can't just appease one side while ignoring the other.

Never believe Democracy works for everyone. That was never the intention and never the reality. Referendums are advisory but you try telling the voters that. Fighting to change opinions is fine but if that's the case, you shouldn't be trying to challenge the previous result, you should try for a second referendum. Much like the SNP are doing. Protests are fine but almost entirely meaningless unless backed up by policy changes. It doesn't particularly matter if people protest, this decision was always going to be controversial either way. Protests were inevitable. If it doesn't affect the overall economy or risk endangering the government's legitimacy, nothing will come of it. You should remember that both camps are guilty of bullying voters into their own views. Never just accuse the others of doing it, both do. Having a majority of 51% in a vote is just as valid as having a majority of 90%, the result is that the majority of voters wanted it. The two thirds point could be said in every election and ultimately, a majority is a majority. The leave side wouldn't have stopped 'fighting' but I'd have told them the same thing: to accept what is, not try to be blind idealists. We can appease one side while ignoring the other, if the one side is the majority, that's how democracy works.""",b'Luke Coyle',2017-04-08 05:23:49,0

I am very much in favour of a second referendum, that is part of the campaigning too. I have never denied that both sides have been as bad as each other with regards to bullying lying or whatever. I know that has been the case, I have never denied that. Representative democracy is where everyone no matter their beliefs are given a chance to voice their concerns. It isn't ignoring them, we are simply showing how disasterous brexit really is and a disaster as I said before will be felt for generations to come. Unfortunately, it will once again hit the poor working class people (which many voted for brexit, but also many voted to remain). Also by the same argument, we shouldn't hold another general election, as the public voted for a majority Conservative government, it was narrow, but like you say, a majority is a majority. That's what people voted for in 2015, does that mean that people who are Labour supporters, Lib Dem supporters etc. Should just stand down and we stay with this majority Conservative government? A second referendum would be the right way to go I agree as we can't shove the decision aside, as that does undermine democracy. But, it shouldn't stop us to campaign to stop brexit as we can put that on the ballot paper if a second referendum comes around, but currently the only ones fighting for a second referendum are the Lib Dems, why Labour isn't fighting for a referendum on the terms of exit is probably because Jeremy Corbyn voted out in the 1975 referendum. But, ultimately, the Eurosceptic side didn't stop fighting to get another referendum and neither should the Pro Europeans.""",b'Harry Thornton',2017-04-08 05:34:15,0

We joined the common market when we were known around the world as the Poor Man of Europe. We were on our uppers and had little hope of growth as we were, so joining up with partners and allies in Europe made economic sense. We\'re as successful as we are (if we ignore the NHS, potholed roads and removal of support for the poor, the sick and the disabled for a moment) because of the EU.

But back then it was just the Common Market, and they\'d already joined without a referendum: it was a renegotiation a year or so after joining (the Labour PM Harold Wilson was annoyed the Tory Heath had beaten him to it, so wanted to join some of the Europhile glory). But the EU gave itself more and more powers over time, via meetings of leaders and so on... with Maastricht in 93 being the crucial jump to its changing its name to the ""EU"" after massive integrative steps. So it depends on your definition of the EU across time. The EU in its current form was not voted upon directly, no. Hence: what specific agreement are we getting out of? Naive not to ask at the referendum but a simple question was the only one that satisfied both Tory factions and UKIP. (Btw, it was the Tories who got Britain into the EEC to begin with, and the Tories who signed onto Maastricht, and Cameron was for Remain while Corbyn was not, so it\'s long been an odd home for Eurosceptics).'",b'Andrew Schaug',2017-04-05 16:50:24,1

There were usually no follow ups to verify that the right decisions had been made. The process was usually shrouded in shame (where that come from?) and secrecy, with both parents and doctors withholding information from the patient. There are numerous accounts of medical records going missing or being burned in mysterious fires. Still today, I am hearing this practice continues.

It's not just about any one thing. If I had to state my reasons for voting Leave, I'd be here into next week. My main reason for voting Leave, is because I believe in our right to remain an independent, free, self governing, sovereign nation. It baffles me as to why anybody wouldn't want the same.""",b'Rachael Ives',2017-04-04 19:27:23,1

However, in many of these areas family planning services are not available and when global health initiatives to provide these services have been launched. Often the choice is for smaller family sizes. Surely you can see why having 3 children contributes more greatly to the population burden than say 2? or 1? There are models that suggest that the worlds natural resources can likely provide a Western standard of living to around 1.5-2 billion people, currently we are at 7 billion and estimated to reach 9.7 billion at current growth by 2050. No children shouldn\'t be punished for their parents decisions, but neither should the parents be rewarded. Currently if you earn you can still receive tax breaks. Do you think this is fair? ""Its not realistic to have provision in your life for partner death"" I am guessing you have never heard of life insurance policies then? I think you are jumping on the extreme example of ""children starving"" when that is the very end of the normal distribution of those receiving child tax benefits.

There are areas of the world where birth rate is above replacement rate, but these are compensated for by areas where the reverse is true (such as Italy). Bangladesh, for example, is now only just above replacement rate. There are a number of structural issues caused by having a lower birth rate than death rate, mostly to do with a lack of people for jobs. One of the effects of cutting back on child benefit and tax credits would be that. Obviously, if you have sufficient immigration, this is much less of a problem. The world does face some issues going forward with the general world population increase but a much greater problem is the obscene rate at which rich nations consume resources. The richest billion people in the world are responsible for half the world's carbon emissions. We seriously need to cut back on air travel, reduce car journey emissions, and freight and the military bear responsibility too. Oh and the reason the world's population is increasing despite the fact that we have reached peak child is that life expectancy is increasing a lot in poorer nations so that's where the next 3-5 billion people will come from.""",b'Philip Dixon',2017-04-04 07:58:21,0

No they seem to be about capital before ethics I am apposed to the shady way they are implementing this policy.

Rejecting the far Left himself when in office he led a first-timer centre right-wing Labour as a magnate to all those who admired the Tories but could not give that party their vote. He won over the middle classes, and many wealthy bosses as well as drawing the voting working class towards Labour. He had the people with him because he offered them something tangible that improved their lives. If Brexit uses the same method it will be a political success and Britain will have emulated his triumph. Onwards and upwards, vote centre, with one foot in the Labour camp and one foot in the Tory camp until we see which foot has the best leg to stand on. Now Jeremy Corbyn has to be far further Left than Blair as it is more in his own nature to be so. And Labour's true modern appeal to a restless and as yet undiscerning voting public of the poor majority. Transferring his personal preferences from self to party is proving a rocky road that many Labour voters think reflects his dereliction of duty in policies that fall short of true conviction, though on the contrary, this can be fairly assumed to be an over-pessimistic view of his political stance always made in good faith. JC's policies also show he has remarkable humanity. Like Blair, JC has said he will house the homeless. But the Police think they rely on making a man homeless to control crime; rapists cannot be brought indoors, or lunatic violent men. And there are too many of them to strictly police when accommodation always means another police call. Blair was simply told 'no' he couldn't bring them in. But a 'ban the bomb' PM would only make the enemy attack as they would know he is mad in an atomic age when terrorists are waiting to break down peace at any cost. And Labour is in the wings claiming it is using its time before the next election to formulate new policies it will present then, for post-Brexit is a wobbly uncertain future yet to be defined and attempted in no vain hope that the Tories will succeed. The British are no fool when it comes to winning through adversity with tenacity, hope, courage and national pride well in place. Labour can only be the running mate in the wings until we see exactly what it is we are dealing with, including our divorce from the EU which appears to produce more than one tactical error in its wake. Labour is playing the waiting game, but is it enhancing JC or is it denying him Labour's true image with a Leader who can in the future lead a new Britain? Blair was always new. Blair's New Labour of old now becomes Renewing Labour with its safe new Britain in a brave new world calling upon some of its old political strengths to garner for this new era. And some of JC's he can reveal to us in his own timely manner. JC can make a marriage between what we have already and where it is going to take us now. Post-Brexit will be his newborn baby and he has to show he can Father our nation. Whilst good old Theresa May is proving she is Mother Nature herself in her PM-ship she has turned into a natural role for a politician adaptable and with true genius; hers is a flawless and uncompromising rivalry as she rises to every challenge astute and aware of difficulties arising she deals with so sublimely. It is going to be a dream-like transition from EU to our going it alone and May will make many new friends for Britain to create our new economy. We can be confident of our Tory post-Brexit, a challenge JC can rise to, but can he climb over and above for Labour? The future will tell. Tony has told Jeremy 'make policy' to reflect Labour's values; Tony was great. Theresa is a natural politician who will make the transition easy. Goodbye EU. When it's war in Europe,we hope you can get your money out to fight each other, for Germany is their forced unwilling puppet on Russia's side and she will drag Poland and the Czech Republic in with her. For Russia left pro-communist leaders in place. And they are frightened of Russia.""",b'Glenys Conroy',2017-04-04 04:52:12,0

This is an important issue - the Government has deliberately and disingenuously called it the \'great repeal bill\' as a bit of red meat to Brexiteers when in fact it does nothing of the kind. Any repealing will come at a later date and will be debated and actioned by Parliament. The purpose of the \'repeal bill\' is to incorporate all EU law currently applicable in this country onto the UK domestic statute books, to avoid us dropping off a legal cliff edge the second we leave the EU. This necessitates a number of technical changes in order for the laws to continue to work, e.g. change ""[name of EU regulator]"" to ""[name of UK regulator]"". At a later date Parliament will then be able to debate which converted laws to keep, amend or repeal. I would direct you to the Government\'s White Paper on the repeal bill, which provides three case studies for the type of necessary technical changes to be addressed by secondary legislation under the bill: 1) references to EU law (which will obviously have to be amended as we will no longer be subject to EU law); 2) references to EU institutions (which I have already mentioned); and 3) references to information sharing with the EU institutions (which may have to be tweaked).

For all this talk I\'ve seen about Henry VIII clauses this really isn\'t reflected at all in the Government White Paper itself, which is all we currently have to go on - it\'s all speculation. The most relevant extract of the White Paper is this one: ""Crucially, we will ensure that the power will not be available where Government wishes to make a policy change which is not designed to deal with deficiencies in preserved EU derived law arising out of our exit from the EU"". While I am not for a second advocating trusting politicians, I do think politically speaking it is unlikely in the extreme that the Government will propose limiting Parliament\'s role for all but mechanical changes of the kind I describe above.

Imagine if at The Battle of Rorke\'s Drift 48% of the troops decided they would desert and join the ranks of the zulus. Imagine during two world wars 48% of our troops jumped out of their trenches or during the battle of Britain 48% of our fighter squadron went and joined Hermann G . I could go on and on but the point is it just never happened. So why now in the 21st century do the 48% want to desert their fellow 52% of soldiers on this battlefield and betray them to give their country to junker and his rotten cronies? Maybe it\'s because bullets are not actually being fired and bloods not being spilled that you have the courage to try and alter the tradition of our proud great patriotic nation. But I\'m going to tell you something..the 52% will never break ranks they will never desert they will never join the ranks of the enemy and they will always stand shoulder to shoulder until they draw that last breath but there is one thing for sure their country will never freely be given away until the last man hits the ground in his own blood.

Imagine if at The Battle of Rorke\'s Drift 48% of the troops decided they would desert and join the ranks of the zulus. Imagine during two world wars 48% of our troops jumped out of their trenches or during the battle of Britain 48% of our fighter squadron went and joined Hermann G . I could go on and on but the point is it just never happened. So why now in the 21st century do the 48% want to desert their fellow 52% of soldiers on this battlefield and betray them to give their country to junker and his rotten cronies? Maybe it\'s because bullets are not actually being fired and bloods not being spilled that you have the courage to try and alter the tradition of our proud great patriotic nation. But I\'m going to tell you something..the 52% will never break ranks they will never desert they will never join the ranks of the enemy and they will always stand shoulder to shoulder until they draw that last breath but there is one thing for sure their country will never freely be given away until the last man hits the ground in his own blood.

We are facing years now of the Construction industry, the NHS and farmers just to name three that cannot find UK workers willing to do any of these skilled and unskilled jobs. Theresa May has indicated that they will ensure highly skilled people can still work here but that does not help the industries I have mentioned. This has a direct impact on housing growth, health care we receive and food we put in our mouths. Also businesses big and small have to know how this is going to effect them in relation to exports, imports, paperwork and time. Students need to know if they can take places in European Universities. When will grants from Europe fade out for research, some has been pulled already because of they don't want to the hassle that lies ahead. Working abroad and health care in Europe will all be effected for UK citizens. These are the details we need to discuss and we need to have our say because we are the ones that will be effected by the decisions that are made. Voting Brexit was just the easy bit.

Finally: If you're willing to flagrantly dismiss a party on one person's mistake, then you have no trustworthy comprehension of how politics works; there tends to be a cabinet behind each leader, approving and reinforcing official policy, or opposing and hampering it.

But once it began to break up, the individual nations were threatened by the prospect of loss of influence and by the predatory characteristics of each other. The Serbs desperately tried to hang on to influence they believed they were due and inevitably it spiralled into violence. What UK and Marie LePen are proposing is the break up of a pan-European organisation that has delivered the longest period of peace for its members, the greatest security and wealth. The Balkans War is a small example of what could happen if Europe starts to divide against itself. As for the EU failing, and relying on NATO intervention; had the EU had a defence force composed of the troops & equipment from across the EU, it could have dealt with it. It didn't and relied on NATO. Its failure in the Balkans is one of the strongest arguments for an EU Army, Airforce & Navy.

You wanted to take us into the euro (what a disaster the monetary union's turned out to be, thank goodness we aren't entangled in that mess), you voted against giving the British people a democratic choice as to whether or not they want to be EU members despite supporting a referendum before (clearly a ploy for electoral gain) and now that the British people have made their choice, you are the only political party pledging to reverse that choice and rejoin the EU. What is wrong with being a self-governing nation? What is the problem with the elected government of this country signing independent trade deals and deciding how business should and should not be regulated? Why do you believe that we must outsource entire areas of policy to a bloated and unelected bureaucracy, whilst paying billions of pounds for this bizarre privilege? Why do you talk down the ability of this country to secure a free trade agreement with the EU despite the fact that other countries who are less economically and geopolitically significant to the EU than Britain have secured free trade agreements?

""Brexiters"" should not have their way. The press and politicians are responsible for duping the public. Theresa May has said many things. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuR5YARjqCM According to the film I just posted she also said ""Immigration has zero value for the UK"" which is completely untrue. As Aaron Turner said It was a systematic, scientifically-reasoned, expertly-coordinated, and highly cynical strategy of deliberate voter misinformation designed by DC-based ""referendum consultants"" Goddard Gunster with one objective and one objective only: a Leave win. Professor Dougan\'s characterisation of the Leave campaign as ""lying on an industrial scale"" was exactly correct. Truth didn\'t matter, democracy didn\'t matter, doing what\'s in the nation\'s best interest didn\'t matter, all that mattered was manipulating the electorate\'s emotions in order to motivate them to vote.

Yes all that happened while we are EU members, but as Martin says none of that is because of the EU, it\'s all down to the governments that we\'ve voted in for the last few decades. And by going through with Brexit, we\'re giving more power to the governments we elect, who certainly for as far as I can remember in my lifetime (admittedly only 30 years or so of being politically aware) seem to have acted more in the interests of big businesses (often making decisions that help profits then going on to boardroom roles at companies they\'ve aided after leaving politics) and currying favour with certain media bigwigs who have way too much influence and access with our leaders. I can\'t claim to know everyone\'s motives for wanting Brexit, but it does seem a lot of people wanted to say a big ""up yours"" to our current political system, with is a sentiment I agree with, but the EU is the wrong target. OUR governments are the people that have underfunded and mismanaged the NHS, sold off our utilities off to private companies who cut back to provide minimal service levels to maximise profits and massively neglected public services for years. It\'s not even just the Tories as much as I despise them, Labour in the Blair era neglected the average people in favour of the people with money and influence. And yet, we the general public keep voting for these people that don\'t care about normal people despite what they might claim, and indeed we swallow the lies pumped out by hugely influential ""news"" sources, and blame the wrong people for the problems in our country. Sorry, bit of a long rant, but I really struggle to understand how people think coming out of the EU is going to improve the issues you mention?

However the public voted overwhelmingly for the two parties who were wedded to the fees and debt model of funding undergraduate education. So when the committee setup under the Labour Government reported back with the recommendation to allow universities not to have a fees limited the party had a choice of just voting against which might mean that the recommendations might go through or try to negotiate a compromise with the Tories. The compromise was to limit the increase to ,000 but scrap the need for students to pay the fees upfront; to raise the earning which repayments had to start to be paid back and to limit repayments to 30 years. The consequence was that Universities got much needed extra cash and that students who went on to earn less than ,000 pa would pay less than they would have done under Labour's system.

(The 1689 Bill of Rights contains the following oath: `I do declare that no foreign prince, person, prelate, state or potentate hath or ought to have jurisdiction, power, superiority, pre-eminence or authority within this Realm.\' Since this Bill has not been repealed it is clear that every treaty Britain has signed with the EU has been illegal.)"" http://www.vernoncoleman.com/euillegally.html'",b'Darren Lee',2017-03-28 19:38:56,0

Having looked into Coleman I can only come to the conclusion that he is neither academic, nor an expert. I can't help but notice he has no formal study in the fields of law, philosophy, or politics; holds no qualifications in any of those fields; and cites no sources in his political essays. I can hardly consider him a credible source, let alone an academic or an expert. Now, regards the sovereignty comment; I trust you are aware that UK law actually is sovereign, and that the EU laws that apply in this country do so because they were folded into UK law. Together with Mr. Jackson's comment above, I think that roundly takes care of Coleman's argument.

Yet more ad hominem attacks and not one iota of explanation as to how we resolve the concerns of remain voters. Ps. Kieren Jameson asking someone if they know something doesn't make it fact. Virtually everything you said about the EU is simply propaganda for the leave vote and the exact opposite of fact ie. A lie. Youth unemployment is not a reason to abandon an institution . The failure of successive uk governments to invest in increased housing and more innovative housing is not anything to do with the EU. I couldn't care less about how many brits abroad vs EU migrants here. I would be quite happy to see the number double because there is nothing inherently disadvantageous about immigration or eu migrants. You may think 70% favour reduced immigration - that's fine, opinion polls are flawed especially if you get them from our right wing press which no doubt you do. It doesn't mean that the reasoning for reducing immigration is sound. Sick of hearing that 'people want reduced immigration' - people want capital punishment (or most opinion polls suggest they would support it and didn't want it abolished). That's why we have governments and civil servants who can rise above populism and racism and other negative 'isms' and create the right (morally speaking) policy. Oh and it's economically sound policy too because immigrants are a net benefit to the public purse (I'm not sure about EU immigrants specifically this is overall figures but I'm reasonably confident the stats stack up for EU migrants too) I have no idea what your point was about regarding multicultural cities - particularly because I struggle to think of an example of a non multicultural city in the UK but also because that just strikes me as an argument for improved policing, seeing as our vote about the EU was not a rejection of multiculturalism or a vote to end all immigration. God... why do I waste my time bothering to speak to people like Brian Toomey. Making assumptions and ad hominem attacks miles off the point and just being generally insulting. I don't have to explain myself to you but I have now been working for 10 years , throughout my education and quite frankly I don't owe my elders anything (except those from my close family and community) so I really have no idea why how long and how hard I've worked has anything to do with the argument. Oh and of course I didn't enjoy free university, going on the dole during my student years or any of the benefits your generation got. Have you worked for long enough to pay off the debt you owe to my grandfather for his efforts in bomber command during the war? Don't worry, he won't be asking you because he isn't as rude as you! I have plenty of respect for the north, but economic facts demonstrate that the wealth generation is driven in the south and you were the one who began with slagging off the liberal south as if we owe you something and we dont. Plus I believe I argued against the politics of division - we are a whole country and so just because the north want out it doesn't mean they can run roughshod over the concerns of those in the south either. Respect goes both ways and I won't be wasting any on someone like you; whose best response is to call someone like me 'sulky' (and little.... I'm 6ft so you were a way off there too). Oh and a man. But I'm not too bothered about that one.""",b'Alexandra Elle C',2017-03-31 14:55:18,0

If national border security is sacrosanct to the BREXIT decision/deal then Britain might have to let Northern Ireland have that referendum vote to join the Republic - this is the UK's weakest link.

Their finance. https://fullfact.org/europe/did-auditors-sign-eu-budget/ The EU has failed to sign off their books for years. Here is some evidence for that..It has been taken from a official sauce. The EU wanted Turkey to join. We spent millions on them and the EU was going to give a loan to Turkey so they could build transits in Turkey that would of taken jobs from us. The EU has been terrible for our fishing industry It is destroying it and there is nothing we can do about it while we are in the EU. They did not take us seriously when it came to our re negotiation giving us a yellow card option that a certain number of states had to agree to in a short amount of time was terrible. Unemployment was and still is very high in most countries within the EU. We have free trade with the EU but the EU says that we should have a 30% tariff on any goods from outside the EU I disagree with that. We are not aloud to sit on the world trade organisation while we are part of the EU.I think this is wrong. We are not aloud to do any trade deals without the EU`s say so. It is against the rules. They are talking about a EU army in Brussels I think that the EU should just concentrate on trade and nothing else. Why do we have two parliaments in Europe that the MEPS spend millions traveling between and why have MEPS at all when we have elected politicians that could do that job at no extra cost. I believe that is wrong. That in my opinion is diluting our democracy. Why is the EU going to have army if it is about trade only. That is wrong. We should have a fair immigration policy for all not for those who live in Europe only. The EU is good for Germany and France and not many other countries. It is creating a two speed Europe. http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/784259/Poland-prime-minister-ridicules-Jean-Claude-Juncker-European-Union-break-up. May I ask why you voted to remain? So to conclude my comment I don`t think that the EU is fit for purpose and it is not open to change. It is not a club that values its members and Is going in the wrong direction.

You didn\'t take into consideration ANY of that. How do I know? Well someone who had gone into so much detail would have understood it better. We had a veto on Turkey mate. We got practically everything we wanted (that was a reasonable request). Unemployment in other countries doesn\'t adversely affect our employment levels..... I could go on. But the biggest indicator of you not actually going into this detail before you voted is a couple of words.... sauce and aloud. Someone who had gone into that level of detail (and not copied those ""reasons"" from elsewhere) would have the knowledge and attention to detail to not make school boy errors with such basic words. I\'m sorry, but I am furious about Brexit and the fact that poorly educated (their own fault) individuals have dragged us down this route. It is farcical and I\'ve given up giving the benefit of the doubt. I voted Remain because.... 1) We get more out than we put in. No matter what it costs, we make more through it. Prove me wrong. 2) I work all over Europe and enjoy the freedoms we *may* lose. 3) The only way to have true equality in this world is to remove these arbitrary borders which do nothing but keep disparity intact. You and I did NOTHING to earn the advantages we have, so we have no reason to feel like we have a right to protect any artificial leg up we get. 4) You mentioned the fishing argument. The restrictions are there for the fishing stocks and the environment. The EU do a lot for the environment. We are forced to do more than we would otherwise. That is GOOD in my eyes. 5) Finally, a vote to Leave was supporting an element who are very distasteful. Whether you choose to admit it or not, a big chunk of Leave voters did so for xenophobic and/racist reasons. I know we are not supposed to say that, but it is painfully clear. By the way, I wouldn\'t dream of suggesting that the EU is perfect. It\'s not. It needs to change.

However, thanks to the total lack of opposition from Labour regarding this madness I find myself listening. There is NOTHING democratic in what is happening now Pete Levs. You obviously have a very scewed idea as to democracy. And talking of the vote the legal definition of a referendum is ""advisory"" and Parliament was always told it was an advisory and they would have the final say (printed in black and white in the bill laid before them). That IS democracy Another promise broken.. What May and this vile back door government want is NOT democracy by any definition of the term. You never had lack of it in the EU you know (unless you are very blinkered) like everything else that\'s a lie. 13% of our laws are EU originated so we have democracy over 83%. But remember Governments also interpret law differently the same EU reg is enacted differently in different countries within a general framework and that is obvious when you walk around a city like Barcelona or use the tapas bars of Andalucia. Let\'s also not forget the little reported admission 6 weeks ago that the UK has now and has always had control over immigration both EU (as we are not part of Schengen) and NON EU (which of course doesn\'t change with the vote last June). There is no lack of democracy or sovereignty in the EU that is myth and garbage and frankly that has been proved time and time again since last June. There is only concrete fact that the referendum was won on LIES (admitted by almost everyone concerned with Vote leave now) therefore as with a court case where the star witness is found to have perjured himself it should be declared (a mistrial) null and void. By all means re run it this time though ONLY facts can be given out (verifiable and verified before publishing) Let\'s then see democracy in play when the public have the TRUTH. I think we all know what would happen. As for the betrayal (for that\'s what it is) of our youngsters those that committed it should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. A neighbour (older than me and I am 61 so no spring chicken) of mine\'s answer, ""I don\'t care about them. I want things back as they were"" However can\'t actually say what was good before and that\'s simply because this perceived paradise did not exist. They are the truth\'s I know I will be trolled for days now but sorry it\'s time the silent MAJORITY (60% did not vote for leaving) started to shout shame they didn\'t last April/May. And where are the Trade Unions?. Their members will suffer most from this debacle why are they not shouting from the rooftops??

The top 3 reasons were: - Decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK - Regaining control over immigration and borders - Concern for expanded EU powers As for ""Many deny our economy will suffer as a result"", no one knows what the short-term, let alone medium- to long-term effects on our economy will be. Every prediction made so far pertaining to the economy has proven to be unequivocally false, aside from that about the pound devaluing, but the IMF has been suggesting for years that the pound was far too strong, and even suggested that it may be too strong post-referendum depreciation; a consequence of this is that it is creating very problematic imbalances in our current account. Do REMAIN voters only listen to the experts when it suits them? Your counter-point to my last paragraph will undoubtably be ""But we haven\'t left, yet!""

It's not possible to just come into the UK and set up a home just because you're an EU resident. You must prove after 3 months that you have employment, hence you are not on the dole. We are about to lose those skills mentioned as a result of immigration, scientists, medics, financial services (one of the main revenue sources for the UK due to Brexit. We've already lost a significant proportion of previously mentioned professions and others. Take nursing, the most important profession in the NHS. EU nurses coming over has fallen 90%, and we will not be able to train enough of our own as our government has now cynically and wrongly withdrawn their bursaries, making the career a hugely complicated one financially for UK residents. Brexit will not bolster our skilled workers intake, it's vastly depleting it. Many who voted Brexit simply do not consider how quickly they've been conned into bashing Schrodinger's immigrant, the one who simultaneously steals your job, and your benefits. As for security checks, wether or not someone is coming here to reside or temporarily, they will have the same check, Brexit won't change that, and as tragic incidents like those this week showed, terror in the UK is homegrown in the UK, not some EU import.""",b'Dave Urwin',2017-03-26 12:51:25,1

With this in mind, the only option open to a rational individual or an individual who cares about this country is to oppose the tories at every point.

Rather than stay on the bank and throw ropes or grappling hooks to haul them back to shore, you instead jumped in the boat and said maybe they should stop drilling holes. That is not enough.

Even a UK Government report showed that there was little to no benefit from such deals other than to the large corporates. A deal which opens up the sale of public services to foreign private companies and as I said, allows the corporations to sue Governments. This is very dangerous as it gives (even more than now) corporations a strong say in policy. The Canadian government have themselves faced numerous court cases from US corps due to their similar trade agreement.

The only benefit is to the large corporations that suck money out of the economy into tax havens, they do not wealth generate as they grow through accusition and consolidation. They have no interest over than increasing profit. The wealth generators are the small to medium businesses that grow through innovation but often struggle to compete due to the uneven playing field.

There's so much wrong in what you've just said I don't think I've got time to go through all of it Joe, not without cooking tea first. Let me just summarise quickly though: poor man of Europe enters the EU. Surprise surprise. That is a good thing. Uk becomes fastest growing economy for a while. 80 and 90's without rose tinted spectacles? High interest rates, inflation, unemployment. Low productivity and problems producing anything worth exporting, least of all on time. Non tariff barriers still in operation effected imports and exports. Latterly austerity by our own GB government means underfunding of NHS and poorest areas rely in EU hand outs because the government won't. EU funds the poorest parts of Europe and yet one of the richest nations gets to have some of it because it doesn't look after its own properly. EU regulations means that we have cleaner beaches, less additives and no GM in our food, safer products and all neatly tested in our own factories so that they can freely circulate in Europe without customs checks at every border... oh, and across the other 50 global markets which the EU already has trade agreements with. Such ignorance on your part is, I'm afraid, unforgivable, not least because it will cost jobs, living standards and our public services, but also because my kids' tea is now late!!!""",b'Ruth Clement Leonard',2017-03-27 14:34:51,1

The second point that needs to be questioned in your argumentation is the fact that people in favour of the EU throughout Europe have different views on what must become Europe. As a french, i can tell you that a lot of persons standing up for the EU do not think that democracy is important (as bespeak Sarkozy's action= the treaty of Lisbonne he adopted in 2009, which some points are the same as would have been the treaty for europe if it were adopted by french people in a referendum in 2005).

And the present lack of shame over his current multitasking is underlined by what seems to be a life rooted in detached insouciance. We should make allowance for this strange troubled creature. I would suggest he has some life sized cardboard cutouts made. The facial expression could be one of quiet trenchant certainty; yet tempered by a kindly light; and yet also with steely eyed conviction; and yet a sparkle of authentic sympathy. I am sure a skilled photographer could somehow accomplish this. With all emotional bases covered the cutouts could be distributed throughout his constituency where troubled folk could share their inner thoughts - a kind of political liturgy - with tea and cakes provided by the Conservative Club.
