In a 29 January 2017 statement, he said: America is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border. America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror.

'Partition' has been around for nearly a century, it's not a new concept. If you've ever received a welfare payment in Northern Ireland, paid UK taxes, cooperated with the PSNI, sent your kids to school, or driven on a road in the north, then you've also accepted the unionist status quo. None of which makes you a unionist by the way. You are getting hung up on pointless symbolism and ignoring the fact that the SDLP is an Irish nationalist party. If you really believe that taking the oath of allegiance is a personal commitment to the Queen, and not a general recognition of the state and its core values, then you are delusional. Jeremy Corbyn is a still a republican despite being sworn in as an MP numerous times. I also doubt that most politicians in Australia, Canada or New Zealand feel that they are obliged to be loyal to the Royal Family. If you're against MLAs recognising WWI and WWII veterans then that's just sad. The SDLP for practical reasons is in Westminster. This means that they can influence the debate on Brexit and represent their constituents. Something that Sinn Fein cannot do.
