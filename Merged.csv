I am rejoining the Conservative Party with tremendous pleasure â coming home to a One Nation party with a drive to deliver for all of Britain.

I'm impressed by Theresa May's ideas and leadership: already laying the foundations for a country that works for everyone; and setting out a proper industrial strategy. In her education speech last week, she showed she leads a party with a real commitment to delivering for the next generation.

I supported Britain's membership of the European Union. But the British people cast a decisive vote and all of us need to deliver on that verdict. I disagreed with the Liberal Democrat leadership â ignoring the vote and continuing with the status quo. So I'm delighted the Tory party is united in its resolve to forge a new role for the UK on the world stage.

Added to this, the Conservative Party in the Lords, with its new leader, is a broad but unified church that understands the purpose of our second chamber: to engage constructively, to scrutinise and revise. Peers should not block the clearly expressed will of the people or the Commons.

I will be fighting for Britain from the Tory benches from now.",,status,,2016-09-11 06:17:52,1068,116,74,1020,38,0,7,0,3,conservatives

Let no one be in doubt that I will oppose, and the Labour Party will oppose, all those who fan the flames of fear at home and abroad.

I support the demand of millions of British people: Donald Trump should not be welcomed on a State Visit to this country while he continues to propagate his anti-women, anti-Muslim and anti-Mexican policies.

This world defeated segregation, we defeated Apartheid and we will defeat this nasty policy created to sow division and hatred.

His invite should be withdrawn until the executive orders are gone and every element of them repealed.

History judges us by the actions we take in opposing oppression.
I am proud that during the 1980s and 1990s I stood with Labour party members, trade unionists and faith leaders opposing the racist regime of South Africa.

I was there on the day Margaret Thatcher opened her door to P.W. Botha while Nelson Mandela languished in a prison cell.
Margret Thatcher and the Conservative Party were on the wrong side of history then just as Theresa May and her Conservative Party are on the wrong side of history today.

Dear Prime Minister,

I am writing to request urgent talks at the highest level to agree urgent action to avert the deepening social care crisis facing many older people this Christmas.

The social care system is breaking down from lack of support. I hope you will be prepared to discuss both emergency support for social care to tide services over until April, as well as longer-term solutions to the funding and restructuring of social care provision.

After Â£4.6 billion of cuts to social care budgets since 2010, more than a million elderly people are not getting the care they need. Social care is in a crisis which threatens the wellbeing, dignity and lives of hundreds of thousands of older people.

The failure of your government, and that of your predecessor, properly to fund our social care system, has meant the burden has increasingly fallen on local authorities, which have themselves suffered heavy and continuous cuts. 

Relying on the council tax to plug the shortfall will lead to a postcode lottery and shift the cost on to hard-pressed council taxpayers. The government must take responsibility. 

In the sixth richest country in the world, it is a national disgrace that elderly and disabled people are being denied the dignity and care they so desperately need. 

This is a question of priorities. Your government has chosen to cut corporation tax while over a million of Britain's disabled and older people are being denied the care they deserve.

We can avert the crisis this winter while developing a sustainable solution that treats all of our disabled and older people with the dignity that they have earned. 

There is an opportunity to avert a crisis this winter. Will your government agree to take it?

Yours sincerely,

Jeremy Corbyn",,status,,2016-12-19 08:19:56,1383,164,673,1280,69,2,5,8,19,Labour

There can be no question that the rights of British citizens to travel within the UK will not be affected by Brexit, and I am very glad that the PM has reiterated that this is indeed the case.

An Irish Sea border artificially splitting the UK was something which many remoaners were keen to flag up as an issue which would affect Northern Ireland. However today we have seen that First Minister Rt Hon Arlene Foster has been on the right side of the argument on our borders and that our voice has been heard.

From the very beginning we said that we did not expect to see a hard border with the Republic, still less, any sort of border within the UK. News that there will not be any de-facto borders should put any fear-mongering to bed.""

Mr Campbell said, 'This is fantastic news, not just for the Causeway Coast area but the whole of Northern Ireland, as the competition will again bring visitors and publicity to the area. Northern Ireland is becoming renowned across the world amongst golf tourists, with Portstewart and Portrush offering some of the finest courses anywhere in the world.
 
This competition is the latest in a long line of major events to come to Northern Ireland and I would pay tribute to the work carried out by the First Minister, successive Economy Ministers, and Rory McIlroy in their role in continuing to ensure that a positive image of Northern Ireland is promoted across the world.

I will continue to work to ensure that Portstewart and the wider area is ready to maximise the benefits from hosting the competition which hopefully will be as popular as it was in Portrush back in 2012.'",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/democraticunionistparty/photos/a.130975336936548.16016.105732052794210/1283659131668157/?type=3,2016-07-26 11:44:12,79,4,8,79,0,0,0,0,0,democraticunionist

135,105732052794210_1270995022934568,"Musical Instruments for Bands funding to be reinstated
 
Minister for Communities, Paul Givan MLA, has told the Newsletter that the Musical Instruments for Bands funding will be reinstated. Â£200,000 of funding will be available for bands across Northern Ireland in 2016/17.
 
The programme, which is distributed through the Arts Council provides grants from Â£500 to Â£5,000 for the purchase of instruments to bands based in Northern Ireland which are formally constituted and who have not received a grant from the fund in the previous five years. It is generally accessed by the marching bands community.
 
The Minister said: ""It was very disappointing for many bands when this programme was suspended last year by the DCAL Minister Caral Ni Chuilin. Whilst the total amount of money available is relatively modest it is still a very important funding source for bands.    
 
The marching bands sector is the largest community arts sector in Northern Ireland with nearly 30,000 people regularly participating in over 600 bands. A huge effort is put in by volunteers who contribute not just musically and culturally but economically. The Â£200,000 funding provided within the scheme is part of over Â£1million spent each year on musical instruments alone.Bands also provide structure, discipline and a social outlet for thousands of young people across the Province and I will continue to work to ensure that adequate resources are available for the sector.
 
Bands from every corner of the Province have benefitted from the funding from inner city areas to more isolated rural communities. Our parading culture has been described as ""Northern Ireland's best kept secret"" and I want to help support and promote it. Over the next few days people across the Province will be able witness the quality of musical talent we have in Northern Ireland. We have pipe, silver, flute and accordion bands which are amongst the best in the world and the vast majority of these will be performing on our streets this week."" 

Since 2011, Â£200,000 has been allocated each year to the Arts Council for the Musical Instruments for Bands Scheme.",Photos from Democratic Unionist Party's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/democraticunionistparty/photos/a.106149206085828.8008.105732052794210/1270994262934644/?type=3,2016-07-09 10:54:15,55,11,5,55,0,0,0,0,0,democraticunionist

DUP Leader Arlene Foster today met with families of those murdered in the Kingsmills massacre. This follows the reopening of a criminal investigation into the sectarian murder of the ten Protestant workmen in 1976.

 

Speaking afterwards Arlene Foster said, 'In common with so many of those who suffered at the hands of terrorism in Northern Ireland, the Kingmills families want truth and justice for their loved ones.

 

Whilst they reopening of the criminal investigation has raised questions in some minds about how this evidence has only come forward now, it does bring open the possibility that someone might finally be held responsible for this heinous crime. That hope of justice is something the Kingsmills families share with many others.

 

I would hope that the investigation can now move swiftly and the families would at least see some level of justice served.'

 

Local MLA William Irwin said, 'Having attended the service in Bessbrook in January, I am glad the First Minister was able to meet with the families again today. There are obviously many mixed emotions following the events of the last few days, but it is important that we stand in solidarity with those who suffered so greatly and who have waited so long for justice.

 

It is vital that the families are kept informed during this process so that their pain is not worsened through being kept in the dark about what is happening. Whilst we await further information about the inquest process I would hope that the criminal investigation can be seen to progress quickly.'",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/democraticunionistparty/photos/a.130975336936548.16016.105732052794210/1244732195560851/?type=3,2016-06-02 09:42:06,42,2,1,41,0,0,0,0,1,democraticunionist

Bernie McGuinness said:

""On my own behalf and Martin's family I want to thank all of those who have offered their condolences since Martin's death, including the countless people who sent messages, mass cards and prayers.

""I want to thank the doctors and the nurses who looked after Martin during his illness.

""I also want to express our deep appreciation of the many thousands of people who attended vigils in the course of the week in many parts of Ireland and overseas.

""From Martin's return home on Tuesday, and until we left for the funeral service on Thursday, long queues of people visited our home. The family took great comfort from their presence. I want to thank the local businesses who during this time very kindly provided food and sandwiches for those visiting the house.

""I want to especially acknowledge the many thousands who attended the funeral. Words cannot express our appreciation at the outpouring of love and solidarity, which embraced us throughout Thursday.

""Finally, I want to thank all of Martin's comrades in Sinn FÃ©in, especially here in Derry, the many stewards, the friends who travelled from overseas, and in particular all of those who attended or participated in the funeral service in Long Tower Church and at the Republican Plot, including the singers and the musicians.

""I and our entire family have been touched by the efforts of so many to provide solace and comfort to us throughout this very difficult period.

 ""Martin was my husband, a father and a grand-father. He was a republican activist for all of his adult life. He was passionate about his political beliefs but also about his many other interests.

Here in Ireland and around the world, women have won many battles for equality, but the struggle isn't over. Not by a long stretch.

We're also reminded of the shocking and disgraceful State-sponsored abuse of women in the not too distant past. Excavations in Tuam have discovered a ""significant quantity"" of human remains at the site of the former mother-and-baby home.

The remains discovered are the bodies of children and babies who were unceremoniously buried here, without any recognition. Buried in a septic tank, without any respect to their identity or dignity.

You can see the Bill at www.sinnfein.ie/contents/43619

Sinn FÃ©in spokesperson for Social Protection John Brady TD and junior spokesperson Denise Mitchell TD have urged all TDs to support the Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age Bill being debated this evening. 

Speaking ahead of the DÃ¡il debate, Teachta Brady said:

""One of the greatest challenges facing us as a country is sustaining the State Pension into the future. We know that pensions are continually referred to as a ticking time bomb. 

""This Bill is about giving workers a choice when it comes to their retirement. That is the issue that TDs are being asked to vote on. 

""And if this Bill is passed, it will do much more than simply abolish mandatory retirement. This Bill will end the scandal of 65 year olds being forced onto Jobseekers payments. It will allow those that have not reached the necessary 520 contributions for the State Pension an opportunity to continue at work and avoid a reduced pension payment. 

""Financially from a Government perspective, workers continuing to pay into the Exchequer rather than receiving payments from it will save money.""

Teachta Denise Mitchell concluded: 

""Minister Varadkar, as recently as last month, announced his intentions to make mandatory retirement ages illegal. This Bill provides him with the perfect opportunity to honour that commitment and do this. 

""The abolition of mandatory retirement has been a long standing policy of Fianna FÃ¡il's and I urge them to support this Bill for the benefit of older workers.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/sinnfein/photos/a.149200528482920.34535.148726998530273/1209130299156599/?type=3,2017-02-23 05:17:26,103,17,30,98,5,0,0,0,0,sinnfein

Sinn FÃ©in Workers' Rights spokesperson David Cullinane will lead a DÃ¡il debate this evening on his Right to Access Bill which seeks to ensure that Trade Unions have access to their members in the workplace.

Speaking today ahead of the debate Deputy Cullinane said;

""The right of trade union representatives to engage with its members in the workplace should not be feared but embraced. It is a right afforded to workers in many countries that are competitive and lead the way in terms of workers rights.

""Our Bill mirrors the Australian and New Zealand model. It is a model which works effectively and is supported by employers groups and trade unions in those countries. It is seen, rightly, as an opportunity to avoid conflict in the workplace and promotes harmonious relationships between a employee and their employer.

""Sinn Fein believes in strong, robust, fair and effective employment rights. We believe in the right of workers to organise, to join a trade union and to be represented by a trade union. We support the right of workers to collectively bargain and see this as inextricably linked to trade union recognition.

""The current voluntary system has worked for some but failed many. Some unscrupulous employers engage in campaigns of bullying, harassment and intimidation. They do so because they can.

""Decent employers should have no truck with such tactics. Those who value their employees have nothing to fear from strengthened labour laws. Those who seek to bully, routinely ignore Industrial Relations laws and ignore our industrial relations mechanisms do so to protect their interests over those of their employees.

""In my view a successful economy is one that values those who contribute to it. A successful employment rights infrastructure is one that operates on the basis of equality and a level playing field between worker and employer.

""A Republic is only a Republic in name if it does not vindicate the rights of citizens. And central to this has to be the rights of people in the workplace.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/sinnfein/photos/a.149200528482920.34535.148726998530273/1208346799234949/?type=3,2017-02-22 04:52:09,151,5,49,150,1,0,0,0,0,sinnfein

51,107584191543_10154783599981544,"An Open Letter from Jenny Palmer MLA to the Members and Elected Representatives of the DUP

Friends,

I do mean that, friends. You will know that I hold some of you very close to my heart, despite everything that has gone on in the past. I know that there are people in the party who are good, honest people. I am making this appeal to you.

Ask yourself, and answer honestly, how many times have you been told that someone will vote for you in spite of your political party? How many times have you had an awkward conversation with a voter or constituent, who said 'I know you, I like you. I don't like the DUP'.

I know, because I used to get the same. I used to get people telling me that while they valued the contribution I made to public life, they were horrified by the behaviour of the upper echelons of the DUP.

Ask yourself another question; how many more scandals? You are a good person, and I know it, but as the famous quote says, 'all it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing'.

I know that many of you are uneasy sharing power with Sinn Fein, but that is part and parcel of how government must be done here in reality. But the scandals aren't.

You don't have to put up with what lurks in the dark core of the DUP. You don't have to pretend not to notice the Red Sky scandal, the SIF mismanagement or the RHI debacle. You don't have to be placated with the lukewarm (or even hostile!) responses from SPADs when you dare to question the leadership in private.

More importantly, you have a responsibility. If you stay silent, you give your implicit consent for the people responsible to get away this this. You alone at this moment have the power to say to those people 'no'. The voters will have their chance in a few years, if not sooner, but at this moment in time, almost no pressure from opposition or the media will have the same impact as you standing up and saying to the party 'no more'.

I know, because I did it. I know what power even a councillor can have by just publicly saying 'this is wrong'.

I understand your reluctance. I know how terrifying it is to go against the juggernaut of the party apparatus. That deep, sleep-preventing fear of 'what if I do it'. That fear that you'll lose friends, you'll lose income, you might even lose your career. I know, because I went through it.

I won't lie to you, it might happen. I lost friends. I lost income. It didn't end my career, because I have the backing of the voters and my new party, but there were no guarantees. But I had to do it, even if my crusade was a lonely one. It was the right thing to do then, and you know that it is the right thing to do now.

More importantly, if even a few of you speak up, the secret will be out. It will be revealed that the Emperor (or empress, as the case may be) has no clothes. The party has you wrapped in a fear that only you feel this way, that this only worries you. That is a lie, and if you speak to your colleagues, you'll find that to be true. Only you have the power to shine a light on the dark corners of the DUP.

And, goodness forbid, if you do find yourself punished for your honesty, you won't be alone. You might find you have friends in surprising places. I know that I did.

I want to close with a few words the late Dr Paisley shared with me when I was going through my own purgatory.

He said, 'keep the faith Jenny'.

The day that was supposed to see the Northern Ireland Assembly start the long and difficult journey of restoring public confidence turned to farce as the Speaker Robin Newton MLA was unable to inform the House under which Standing Order today's special sitting was being held.

Mike Nesbitt MLA said:

""The Speaker wrote to MLAs on Friday saying he had received valid notice from the First Minister and deputy First Minister that they wished to make a statement on the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal.  But on Sunday deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, made clear Mrs foster would not be speaking with his authority, this invalided Standing Order 11. 

""When I challenged the Speaker repeatedly he was unable to name a Standing Order eventually pointing the House to Standing Order 18.  But this refers to ministerial statements and the whole point is that this is a personal and not ministerial statement by Mrs Foster.

""Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, the reputation of devolution has plummeted from the gutter to the sewer. 

""I urge the Speaker to reflect over Christmas as to whether he is the man to lead the Assembly in 2017.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ulsterunionistparty/photos/a.151103841543.115380.107584191543/10154727473076544/?type=3,2016-12-19 08:28:22,24,10,8,23,1,0,0,0,0,ulsterunionist

The law remains weighted towards the perpetrators of terrorism, be they Irish, Islamist inspired, or any other politically motivated group.

Ulster Unionist Leader, Mike Nesbitt MLA, has secured an assurance from the Director of Public Prosecutions that he will not stand idly by in the face of unduly lenient sentences for animal cruelty cases. The Leader of the Opposition was speaking after meeting Barra McGrory QC and senior staff at the Public Prosecution Service.

Mike Nesbitt MLA said:

""I was heartened by the Prosecutor's obvious determination to use his newly bestowed powers to refer any sentence handed down for animal cruelty to the Supreme Court, should he believe the sentence is unduly lenient.

""His ability to make referrals only came into effect on the 1st of August and no case of an unduly lenient sentence has come forward in the last seven weeks. But animal lovers should take heart that the Director has alerted all his prosecutors and regional staff to monitor sentences in cases of animal cruelty and stands ready to intervene when appropriate.

""Barra McGrory has a track record of interventions in other areas where unduly lenient sentences have seen the guilty given probation, suspended sentences or concurrent rather than consequential sentences.

""My only concern is that there is no precedent for a successful challenge for an unduly lenient sentence for animal cruelty in this jurisdiction, and therefore no guarantee the first appeal will be successful. However, I am reassured that Barra McGrory and his team take animal cruelty very seriously and will not be found wanting if the courts need challenged.""

The Ulster Unionist Party is to form the first Official Opposition within the Northern Ireland Assembly.
 
Party Leader, Mike Nesbitt MLA, announced the decision to the Assembly as it sat for the first time since the 5th of May Elections, saying:
 
""We asked for a mandate to enter the talks on the next Programme for Government, promising that if either of our two tests were not met, we would form an Official Opposition.
 
""Those tests were whether it was a progressive Programme and secondly, whether we sensed a will from the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in to lead collective delivery.
 
""On Tuesday, it became clear the Programme for Government will not be finalised until the end of the year, seven months away. On that basis, our primary test of whether it is a progressive Programme for Government, has failed.
 
""Our second test was whether we sensed a will to collectively deliver the Programme and that has also failed, as it is clear the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in will retain joint ownership of the Programme for Government.
 
""Given the evidence that little is about to change, and we face another five years of DUP / Sinn FÃ©in carve up and mutual veto, we are convinced the right thing to do for the country is to forego our entitlements in government and establish an Official Opposition, to both scrutinise the work of the next Executive and offer the electorate something different next time around.
 
""The decision to go into Opposition was taken unanimously by the Ulster Unionist Assembly Group earlier today.
 
""This heralds a new era for devolved politics at Stormont, and a big, bold step forward to normal democracy for Northern Ireland.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ulsterunionistparty/photos/a.151103841543.115380.107584191543/10154075365746544/?type=3,2016-05-12 09:14:34,188,41,67,182,4,0,0,1,1,ulsterunionist

Mike Nesbitt said:

""Gerry Adams` comments are beyond the pale. I find it extraordinary that the leader of a political party can even think to utter the words that he did. In the past he has made clear that he is happy to use equality as a 'trojan horse' to further his own political agenda and now this. Add his denial of membership of PIRA and Gerry Adams has no credibility. Even some within his own party must realise that now.

""To try to liken the fight against slavery to what was happening in Northern Ireland in the 1960s is contemptible. And then for him to claim that he was one of the founders of the civil rights movement. â even Martin McGuinness must be rolling his eyes at that one. The Civil Rights campaigners wanted to reform Northern Ireland not destroy it. This is just Gerry Adams trying to re-write history.

145,107584191543_10153952948261544,"Ulster Unionist Leader, Mike Nesbitt, has praised the Royal British Legion for today's ceremony commemorating local soldiers serving in the British Army who lost their lives in the 1916 Easter Rebellion.

29 of the 116 soldiers who died 100 years ago were from Irish Regiments, including 19 year old Alexander ""Sandy"" McClelland, who had volunteered to join his elder brother on the Western Front, but was sent to Dublin amid rumours of a rebellion, and died on the 27th April 1916.

His memory was honoured today when the local branch of the RBL paraded from Greyabbey Village Hall to Rifleman McClelland's grave at St Saviour's Parish Church, a few miles from his home in Balligan on the Ards Peninsula.

Mr Nesbitt said: 

""It was good to see the Royal British Legion take steps to ensure we remembered all who died in Dublin 100 years ago, not just the leaders of the Rebellion.

""Sandy McClelland was just 19 years old, far too young to die, as were so many of those who were killed in the Rebellion.

""No one needed to die that weekend, just as no one needed to die to get us to where we are today, a place where self-determination saw huge numbers vote for peace following the 1998 agreement.

""I look forward to leading an Ulster Unionist delegation to Dublin in ten days time, when we will offer a unionist perspective on the Rebellion, challenging the causes and consequences of what happened.

""The Rebellion was a seismic event, which reverberates today. It cannot be ignored. I am grateful to the organisers of today's commemoration who have ensured young lives, lost too early and without reason, are not forgotten.""",Photos from Ulster Unionist Party's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ulsterunionistparty/photos/a.151103841543.115380.107584191543/10153952944821544/?type=3,2016-03-27 16:36:06,129,4,26,129,0,0,0,0,0,ulsterunionist

154,107584191543_10153933501446544,"Ulster Unionists publish Cancer Care policy paper

The Ulster Unionist Party has today launched the fourth in a series of detailed policy papers. The latest document focuses on the growing concern for cancer care across Northern Ireland.

Some of the key proposals in the paper include:

Setting a target date of 2035 for Northern Ireland to be tobacco free with a recorded incidence of less than 5%;

Introducing a dignity charter across each of the Health and Social Care Trusts so that patients are at the centre of their care and decision making process;

Ensuring that every patient diagnosed with cancer has access to a Clinical Nurse Specialist;

Improving GP access to diagnostics by giving them the power to refer directly for key diagnostic tests;

Reducing the age for the bowel screening programme to those aged 55;

Ensuring children and young people with a cancer diagnosis are able to access quality alternative provision to continue their education.

Ulster Unionist Party Leader, Mike Nesbitt MLA, said:

""Very few people across Northern Ireland have managed to escape being touched by cancer, be it personally or through witnessing the impact it has on a family member or friend. It is an intensely cruel and unforgiving disease and it is the number one cause of death with sadly up to 4,000 people here succumbing to the ravages of the disease every year.

""Yet the reality is more than one in three people in Northern Ireland will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, and in only 5 years' time that rate will have risen to almost one in two.

""The scale of the disease, and the even greater prominence it is going to display over the years to come means that cancer prevention, early detection and timely treatment must remain a top priority within the health agenda for Northern Ireland. In this document you will see how the Ulster Unionist Party proposes to contribute to that process.""

Ulster Unionist Party Health Spokesperson, Jo-Anne Dobson MLA, said:

""A cancer diagnosis not only shocks the patient but also their entire circle of family and friends. In recent weeks I lost one of my closest friends to the disease and it has unfortunately become one of the most significant health concerns we as a society are facing.

""Whilst the number of people being diagnosed with cancer here is growing year-on-year, we should take some comfort that rapid advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer means that more of us are beating the disease than ever before. It certainly is no longer the death sentence it once was and with every passing year our local research institutions are making ground-breaking innovations. 

""It is essential however that for those who are not fortunate enough to beat the disease that they are treated with the care and dignity to give them both comfort and peace in their final months. That is why I am particularly pleased that we have suggested a number of sensible proposals to improve end of life care here in Northern Ireland.""

Sandra Overend MLA said: 

""International Women's Day is an opportunity to reflect on how far we have come in the fight for gender equality.  The significance of the progress in the democratic system is not lost on me as I come to the end of my first term as a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, seeking to be elected for a second term. 

""Today also provides the opportunity to look at the work still to be done.  We must not forget that we live in a world where gender can still define the direction of travel of your life.  It can still prevent you from having access to an education.  There are women who are still subject to slavery, trafficking and female genital mutilation.  This must motivate us all to bring change. 

""While we should celebrate how far we have come in nations such as the United Kingdom, we must refocus on what still needs to done to progress gender parity both here and across the world.

""I`m looking forward to the next couple of months. It`s a new challenge, but I`ll use all my past experience of working on the ground to get out and about and speak to as many people as possible before 5th May.

I have worked alongside people in some of the most difficult circumstances of their lives and from these experiences I`ve developed a compassionate understanding of people's needs. I am committed to social justice in education, community development, health and wellbeing, capacity building and addressing the needs of real people and their too often challenging circumstances.
 
""I will work with everyone to increase community safety, bring better housing, increase job opportunities and build an inclusive, welcoming community for all. I believe that we can create a more vibrant North Belfast in which successes are celebrated and built upon, but that will also require urban redevelopment.
 
""I want young people to be able turn their lives around, achieve their potential, and know that they are valued members of society and can become contributors to building the vibrant North Belfast which we all want. If North Belfast is to become as multi-cultural, lively, diverse and welcoming as we want it to be then provision needs to be made for the needs of everyone and for accessible services. All communities need to bring their hopes and concerns to the urban redevelopment agenda. I will work to give everyone a voice and to deliver the kind of urban redevelopment that will change the face of North Belfast making it a bright, engaging place to live, work, bring up children and invest in.

We must stand together, shoulder to shoulder and face them down. It is possible to stop this. The history of terrorism is that it only survives when there is a level of community support, be it the act of the turning of a blind eye.
