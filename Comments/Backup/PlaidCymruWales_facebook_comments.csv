For all the flaws in Rand\'s own philosophy, she understood perfectly well why communism doesn\'t work: namely, it suffers from a severe tragedy-of-the-commons problem. It\'s untenable to pay everyone the same regardless of how productive they are, because free riders who contribute nothing will exploit the system to the point of collapse. There\'s a scene in a later chapter that makes this logic explicit.\n\nAnd yet, she proposed an ideology that suffers from exactly the same problem! If the government is funded by voluntary donations, there\'s a selfish incentive for people to use its services without paying their fair share for its upkeep. Just as with communism, the inevitable appearance of free riders would drain the state and ensure its downfall.

And do you know what I saw mass rejuvenation of lots of areas that were really run down when I lived in Wales 20 odd years ago. Funding? All EU. There hasn't been anything like that in the Fenland towns and villages round by us. Wales has truly shot itself in the foot by voting for Brexit. The Westminster parliament will not be giving Wales or anywhere else in UK the type of investment the EU did. Was some of that money from the UK originally? Probably but don't think that the Brexit MPs in Government are looking to be handing out loads of money to Wales or anyone else. They are still going to be implementing more cuts that will continue to decimate our country, Social Care, NHS, schools, sixth forms - you name it. Look out for 2017/ 2018 with the new wave of cuts and then ask yourself why the Government have not honoured ploughing all that 'EU' money Boris & Gove promised would go back into the NHS, and all the other promises they gave that Leave voters bought into. We have turned our back on a community of countries with which we shared alot of ties, values, finances, business and shared history etc with to isolate ourselves so we can all start turning on each other. Welsh, English, Scottish, N Irish all reviving the old hatreds - some United Kingdom. Oh well we can always suck up to countries that have elected a fascist, racist, supports torture, anti immigrant, anti freedom of the press and religious faith, anti women & trans gender, war mongering mysoganist narcissist who throws tantrums, persecutes those who speak out and tells lies to get his own way and is in league with Putin - yea!

We can't stifle debate or resort to personal attacks. But, the SNP... a 'laughing stock'? A party with 56 out of 59 Scottish MPs, been in power in Scottish Parliament for the past 10 years (and getting stronger all the time), and increased its membership and support over the past 3 years more than any other party in the history of the UK.

The referendum reflects the will of those people that voted on a given day six months ago. Since then it has become apparent that many of the statements and assurances made by the Leave campaign were entirely without foundation and often lies. It therefore cannot be certain that those people who voted Leave or Remain would choose to vote in the same way now that they know some of the facts.\nSince the Tory leadership change, Theresa May has acted very much like a medieval prime minister. She has regarded parliament with at best disdain and at worst superfluous to her government. Her entourage have aped her and made statement implying that anyone who disagrees is somehow traitorous. She has attempted to rule by the royal prerogative, something abandoned centuries ago.\nOur MP's who we elect to act to represent the range of views and interests of their constituents appear have largely abandoned this role, transfixed by the success of the Leave propaganda and the referendum result. Even though the majority of MPs were and are pro-Remain and for many their constituents are Remainers, they appear to have abandoned their duty to represent their constituents and their diverse and varying interests and concerns. They are there to hold the government to account. If MPs are simply going to follow the diktat of the coterie that compose the cabinet, then there is little purpose for having them.

The retail sales peak was driven by a boom in tourism following the fall in the value of sterling. Sterling was kept from falling through the floor by vast sums being spent by the treasury to prop it up. Already food and other commodity prices are rising. A significant number of companies are reporting falls in sales due to economic uncertainty and the fall in real earnings. (Yes, we all took a pay cut)\nThe Leave campaign alluded to continuing support to farmers, but it is now apparent that this is very short term and it is highly unlikely that the new global markets will pay significantly higher prices so that farming is economic. In all likelihood the trade deals that UK enters into with the brave new world out there will include full tariff free access for US, Canadian, Australian and NZ farmer to UK markets, and UK will be flooded with cheap fish and meat.\nWhere the Leave campaign did lie, was lying by omission.

I work in the public sector procurement, and I am watching several contractors getting ready to throw the towel in because commodity costs have gone through the roof due to the fall in sterling. We will then have a choice; seek contracts of the same value but for fewer services; or higher prices for the same services. In both scenarios the public looses. There are other contracts were due to Dollar ~ Euro ~ Sterling exchanges components have gone up by 30% since the referendum, but we must buy the items. Therefore something else in the public sector has to be cut. By mid-year I estimate that this will start really hurting. \nAlso due to Brexit key skill workers, who were already in short supply, are returning to the EU and there are no UK / Commonwealth qualified personnel to replace them. Even if there were the money in place and the political will, it would take 5~7 years to train UK apprentices to the required skill level. Many UK school leavers are so poorly equipped in terms of numeracy and literacy that they cannot get onto the skill training courses. Our contractors simply can't deliver services because there is no one in the market to do the work. \nJust because you don't see it in your life now, please do not assume that the predictions are not coming true. \nMrs May and her gang will tell you anything to make it look like they are in control, they are not.""",b'Rod Davies',2017-01-25 17:19:34,0
