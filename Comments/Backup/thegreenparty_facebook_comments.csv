But it almost never works out that way. Why? Because introducing the private profit motive into what should be a public service always diverts spending away from providing services and into the pockets of shareholders. Which leads to private companies spending the bare minimum on staff, equipment and maintenance, without lowering prices for the public. Prices in many cases have actually risen dramatically - see railways, water rates, electricity and gas prices to name a few.\n\nSo no, privatizing the NHS (even partially) is not going to reduce healthcare spending. It's actually going to do precisely the opposite. Ok, so the government outlay might be lower if they can somehow avoid giving huge subsidies to private companies - another disease of privatization that doesn't reduce government spending by much in reality. But the cost of buying private health insurance will certainly be a lot more per head of population than it currently costs us in taxes to fund the NHS. The only possible way to avoid that is to deny coverage to high risk groups - the elderly or those with chronic or pre-existing conditions.

The main problem we have with British politics is FPTP voting system that pits voters to vote tactically and not for what they want in fear of letting their least liked candidate win. A vote for green can put pressure on other candidates to adopt stances such as vote reform and environmental protections.\n\nIn a swing seat this is compounded as the other parties will pander for your vote more and are more likely to change  a their stances that would enable changes for the better.\n\nOf course this is all optimistic as we all know politicians have a habbit of saying one thing and doing the opposite. Which is why the greens are different, because the green party is about green politics, people power and true grassroots movements which make it easy to ensure green candidates are held to account which is only for reassurance mind you as a green candidate would themselves be fearce advocates for what they believe in, which is usually putting people and planet first. I hope this helps and I maybe back with more if I can think of anything else. :)""",b'Callum Moss',2017-04-07 04:54:00,1

In a cowardly manner, like all the panellists he played to the crowd, was afraid to speak truth and demonstrated a lack of insight on two key populist issues. \n\nOn Syria, not a single panelist had the courage to question what Assad's motive could possibly be - on the eve of burgeoning peace talks - for a chemical weapons attack of this sort. No, the line was, he's a monster and we hate monsters. He done it - despite a lack of clear evidence, green lighting cruise missile attacks by the US now and a dangerous ramping up of global tension. Did anyone ask whether the attack could have been set up by Isis, Al Qaeda, or by factions within Assad's military, a hit on terrorist chemical weapons cache, or a false flag operation involving say the CIA (whose record speaks volumes)? Did any panelist mention Mosul and how this covers up the death of civilians probably in the thousands there over recent months, which instead of being portrayed as heinous crime is presented as a delicate military operation? \n\nOn Livingstone there was one clear baying crowd truthspeak, a philosophically convoluted and ultimately untenable line of fear (Abbott at least understood that Livingstone would likely win in court), that Livingstone who has spent his life fighting racism at its core has the temerity to challenge the racist power of zionist ideology and the evil apartheid prison state of Israel, which has been in breech of the UN over decades including illegally possessing nuclear weapons. Being Jewish doesn't give you the right to speak for all Jews. There are many Israeli's and Jews across the world who are deeply critical of zionist ideology and the Israeli state and are also aware of the complexities of pre WWII deal with wealthy zionists in Germany (who arguably had the opportunity to help Jews in Germany under Hitler, but chose not to). Livingstone has always been extremely careful not to conflate being Jewish with zionism (it may soon become a crime not to - understand the implications of the US December 2016 Anti-semitism Awareness Act), but has not been afraid to confront the inhumane Israeli State. The using of Jewish people generally in this manner as a political tool by right wing zionists and pro-Israeli state actions is the real anti-semitism.

In terms of education it still stands that the biggest barrier to success is the own attitude of the pupil. Myself I went to a fairly poor primary, same for my first secondary, but the education I got myself because I had desire is what allowed me to have a varied career in some innovate places switching whole fields of speciality. \n\nAlso what about the hundreds of private companies- like hedge funds and other banking systems that benefited from their staff having received a free education? Also, teachers often do not receive much, if anything more in terms of pay for working within the UK private sector. Education betters society by creating intelligent people. It also betters society by making them have a more prosperous future and hopefully less need to seek state aupport- both through better being able to understand life (such as biology classes teaching when they need to see a GP and when it is a Virus just take rest and stay away. To being able to have a fulfilling work life.\n\nTalking about the parents having avoided tax is completely off subject and unrelated.\n\nAndy Haring, 'luckier' not necessarily. As I said having worked in a variety of avenues including schools in wide spectrums of the population, private doesn't mean better.\n\n Also again the extra cost- the cost of having to find places (to the taxpayer) is far greater for those that are pushed out of being able to afford a private education. Already by paying for it they cut the costs to the state/taxpayer and the idea of 'if they can't afford it with VAT send them to state school' is a blind one.\n\nOh and by the way, I am not pro private.

This is wrong. The teachers are largely the same. The bigger influence is your child. If your hold likes to learn they will- even without a teacher (I learn almost nothing from teachers, I was too far ahead by myself). If your child is lazy, fell behind at primary because they didn't read with family at home in primary, doesn't care is on a poor diet so is hungry, and generally doesn't care.

Firstly there are a huge amount of people who work 2 or 3 jobs to send their children to private schools for a better start. They're not millionaires.

Penalising the wrong people is NOT the answer. \n\nYES every child needs to be getting proper decent food regardless of background in the same way that every child should get a decent education, regardless of background.   But they're not getting either, now. So go back to the reasons why some people are having to work their arses off to send their kids to private schools. Why do they feel they need to do that? If I had Children I would do the same.\n\nThere is the first fundamental problem with the entire education system and not just dinner time. Teachers are working their arses off to get the grades that keep central government happy with fake stats that produces children that are poorly educated and not ready for the big world. THIS IS NOT THE TEACHERS FAULT. This is the crazy system of targets. For FUCK SAKE \xe2\x80\x93 targets???!! Also Teachers need to be able to discipline, too. State schools have become unruly, teachers have become terrified to actually teach and they work to a set criteria and syllabus that's not fit for purpose. GCSES's and A' Levels are worthless. Truly worthless. Again this is NOT the teachers fault. \n\nEvery year the government, both Labour and Tory, laud their policies as success by hailing 98% success rates in GCSE. That tells me they've failed miserably. The world is ugly and, in truth, not all Children are academic. Some have other innate skills outside of numbers and writing. We all know this to be a self evident truth SO how can 98% pass a GCSE? Because they're too fucking easy and, in some cases, fudged to show success. We then have a generation leaving school who cannot read or write, properly or even add up.\n\nTheresa May is about to spend billions on free schools. Labour tell the whole of UK, right now, that that will be reversed immediately. THAT MONEY will be used to bring true education standards back.

Today the far greater EU makes up just 17% world GDP, forecast to be 15% by 2020. It doesn't take an Einstein to work out that this project isn't only past it's sell-by date, but is in terminal economic decline (the only trading block on this planet that is). The idea that the UK will be the first and last to leave is delusional. It's over, and not too soon.\n\nHow anyone can call an institution that presides over 50-60% youth unemployment in it's southern states while it pays thousands of bureaucrats six figure salaries for non-jobs - as being pro-European astounds me. The EU isn't pro-European. It's anti-European to the point of being misanthropic. \n\nSomeone with just a rudimentary knowledge of economics can tell you that separate nation states with separate governments with separate economic policies cannot share a common currency without these huge discrepancies to the detriment to the poorer states. That's also a moral issue.\n\nI love the Green Party in all other policies and will continue my support. I will never understand why a party that purports to support economic and political localism,  is so obsessed with this car crash of a union. I can only hope my suspicions that certain individuals at the top missing out on a potential cushy number in the higher echelons of the EU, have had their noses pushed out of joint, are wrong. \n\nI respect the Remain supporters and accept the weird position the Green Party has taken. What I would really like to see an end to is this mindless, sanctimonious name calling and implications that 17 million of their fellow countrymen are racist,  narrow-minded, right- wing and uneducated.

We could\'ve remained in the strong position we had(the EU was totally dominated by France, Germany and the UK) and argued for a solution to the problems the EU faces.

Then the engine is sent to the UK for insertion into the Mini, and then many of the minis are sent back across the channel for sale elsewhere in the EU. WTO tariffs would apply to each stage of this, making production far more expensive. \n\nIf I were trying to build up the motor industry in, for example the Czech Republic, would I want a tariff free deal for the UK? Nope, I\'d block one in fact, because I\'d want to increase the likelihood that BMW will move the milling and finishing operation (at a minimum) to within the EU, and preferably the final production as well.

No one is proposing forcing this on employers. If anything it would be higher paid employees this would happen to at first. Again - optional. There are plenty of sectors of high skill economy where it's completely feasible.\n\nAny business that is making as low as 20% value on employee working hours is probably a poor business to begin with, or a new, not very established business. It depends on the sector, but high paid workers produce much more value to the business then they are paid, as do low paid employees. How many coffees does a Costa barista need to make to pay for their hourly average wage? Not very many. Which is why there's a Costa in every town in the country - they add much more value than they cost.\n\nAll businesses should earn more value from every employee than they provide. That's just a profitable expanding business. \n\nThe question is where that value goes. If you are building a startup business and are giving yourself low wages, that doesn't mean no value is being created, it means the value is invested back into the business for future higher returns. If you can afford to take on an employee, and you are paying them poor wages, then any value they are creating is again being used as value to help the business grow.\n\nPaying poor wages is a choice, not a necessity. If you are paying your employees a salary below their market rate, then they are giving you charity - it's that simple. That charity may be fine with both them and you, but don't pretend it's inevitable. If it IS required then your business has much bigger problems than wages.""",b'Chris Gilbert',2017-04-03 01:48:13,1

The evidence suggests that a worker doing 6 hours a day gets as much done as one doing 8 hours (which is a slightly different proposition to the one the Greens are proposing, and I think a better one), i.e. there is not a linear relationship between productivity and hours worked. Now, companies are free to ignore the evidence and make their workers do longer days for little to no benefit, but think about this from a worker's perspective. Which company will the best workers want to work for - the one that has them work 6 hours a day, or 8, for the same money? So, the companies that have shorter days will start attracting better workers who have higher productivity, increasing the cost/productivity ratio for those companies (until such time as all companies have 6 hour work days). A worker who has a better work/life balance will be a happier worker, a happier worker takes less sick days, and a happier worker is less likely to move to a different job.

It would be difficult if some businesses operated 4 days and other 5 days. Perhaps shift work between employees could ensure the business operated the standard hours and days? Like in many service industry jobs that cover 7 days a week. If a 3 day weekend was introduced, it would give employees more leisure time and create more job roles in the economy as more people would be needed to cover the other hours. If people had more leisure hours it that could also boost leisure and entertainment sectors. People would have more free time and energy to spend money. Though employers might have some problems with managing more employees and perhaps extra costs and paperwork. The benefits of happier, healthier more productive employees might outweigh those problems though.

Now that we\'re in the transition for the whole Europe thing, I\'ve been working 50 hours a week to try to get my team integrated and up to speed as the stuff I\'m inheriting ran on a very different logic to what I do and wasn\'t administered very well.

Cutting out a whole day would have a rather different effect. \n\nAs to sick days, in my experience, just treating your staff better cuts those down. To reference the two offices I mentioned above, in the crap one, I didn\'t have to be feeling particularly bad to take a day off, because they way they were treating me meant that I didn\'t want to be there (that office was my first accounting job and when I left, I honestly thought ""is that what work\'s like, why the hell would I want to do that every day?""). With my current job, I\'m working comparable hours now, but the only way I take a day off is if I don\'t feel I can drive there safely. If I can, I\'ll go in even if I end up having to come home later because I *want* to be there. I\'m doing a comparable role, I\'m working comparable hours, but one was exhausting, the other is challenging me. Like I said, I\'d rather work 70+ hours a week where I am than 5 minutes in that first office.\n\n The biggest difference - the culture of the offices. The first one was very blame oriented. If you couldn\'t get the work done in time, it was your fault (even if it was a server crash or a total blackout). There was no consideration that there weren\'t enough resources or that the process was flawed, it was your fault. New office, if I go ""I couldn\'t get it done"", then we look at why.

By providing an article which itself is from 2013 and within provides previous examples of this issue arising (such as 2008) in myriad countries from myriad groups, I made a basis for it not being new, revolutionary, or Green.\n\nThe only other thing I stated was that other countries ""work shorter weeks"" which you may want to note is not the same as ""longer weekends,"" this is a factual statement based on the amount of hours some countries work compared to others, which also adds weight to the fact that it\'s not revolutionary or new.\n\nActually, in places like the US, working hours used to be even longer but have declined from times like the Civil War. Between 1913 and 1919 weekly hours fell by about 8% and in 1926 Henry Ford standardised the five-day workweek, instead of the previous and common six days. This suggests that there might be a natural shift towards shorter working hours, and it will especially come into play more and more in the modern world as automation increases.\n\nWhat I did was make a simple statement and then provide the basis for it in order to generate further discussion. What you did was react in a knee-jerk fashion to go immediately on the attack, perhaps because someone else had put you on the back foot but this isn\'t a helpful response.\n\nI suggest if you want further reading on why some people advocate for even shorter hours now that you read things like the stuff below.

I don\'t have that historic knowledge so I\'m constantly having to say ""can you send me a copy of the agreement or emails where you got that?"", which is tedious for me and incredibly annoying for them. \n\nSo while having a few people on a 3 day week with people tagging in and out might work in retail/sales/general customer facing work, it wouldn\'t work properly in functions like accounts, marketing, quality assurance, supply chain or legal.'",b'Andrew Ward',2017-04-02 13:07:01,0

There may be many people with similar workloads and responsibilities around you, because that's the environment you work in, but overall you are in a very small minority. \n(Context for everyone else: We know each other.)\nThere is no such thing as a functioning (pre-automation) economy that has more people in upper management positions than shop floor and manual labour ones. Until drones go widespread and we actually end up fully abolishing a substantial portion of all jobs (which I think is probably still a few years off), Tesco for example will always need significantly more shop floor staff and store managers than they will need accountants and tech support guys.\n\nAnd, additionally, when I worked tech support? We got a lot of downtime, especially on the night shift (I distinctly remember sometimes we could go a full hour without receiving a single call to deal with). Granted we needed several people there at all times to ensure 24/7 coverage but not all of our working hours were used productively. I read most of A Song of Ice and Fire on my evening shifts there for lack of anything else to do, yet frequently felt like I didn't get enough time to myself while spending 9 hours a day away from home and doing something that dozens of other people can do.\n\nThe 4-day work week may not be ideal for every sector, but it doesn't need be applied to all of them (just as- to my own ire- unsociable hours pay isn't), but would be more than valid to roll out to a substantial portion of jobs and if it were established as a social norm the benefits would be huge (at the very least even if you wouldn't get an extra day off, you'd have to be offered overtime pay for one weekend day a week).\nI respect the fact that you do a job very few other people are able to, and which is close to impossible to hire someone else to do in tandem with you, but I feel a 4-day working week is both helpful and possible to millions of other people, even if you (sadly) don't count among them.""",b'Carl Butcher',2017-04-02 18:49:02,0

Germany is at the heart of Europe and guaranteed by just about every developed Western nation, through NATO. An attack on one is an attack on all.

Think IDS and the cuts in state benefits and the way it is assessed by  a private company who have a financial incentive to reduce the 'burden' to the state.  As we go through the process of leaving the EU I think there might just be a realisation of a new reality that our current and future discontent is not about regaining our democracy, immigration, Islamic extremists, or inability to fund the NHS because of the Brussel Bureaucrats or spongers like N.Farage, or so-called austerity.

A second person wishing to attend the 2017 Global Greens Congress, which opened today (March 30, 2017) in Liverpool, England, has now been denied entry into the country. An unnamed woman, who is a member of the Pakistan Green Party, will not be able to attend the event. British authorities indicated the fact that she was a single women made her a risk. Caroline Lucas, Green Party of England and Wales\'s co-leader, described the reasoning behind the rejection as a ""disgrace"" and said the rules needed an urgent rethink. ""This bizarre visa refusal from the Home Office is both utterly nonsensical and extremely insulting,"" she said. ""Green Party members from across the world are coming together in Liverpool this week to debate the big issues we\'re facing \xe2\x80\x93 yet delegates are apparently being rejected for being single. Such action from the Home Office is a disgrace \xe2\x80\x93 and they should urgently rethink the rules so that Britain can be home to political debate \xe2\x80\x93 rather than shutting ourselves off from the rest of the world."" The Home Office told The Independent that its decision to refuse the woman entry to the UK was ""in line with UK immigration rules.""

Pass it on so that everyone you know knows SOON....\n\nDismal, dismal news for public education.....\nThe school voucher system proposed by Education secretary Betsy DeVos does not mean you can choose any school you want your kid to go to. It means the public education program will be dismantled.\nIf your child has an IEP (individual education plan for students with special needs), kiss it goodbye.\nIf you have a job in special-education, if you're a special education teacher, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech pathologist, a para, a teacher's aid, or an ESL (English as a second language) teacher, you'll go first.\nHouse Bill 610 makes some large changes. Inform yourselves. This bill will effectively start the school voucher system to be used by children ages 5-17 and starts the defunding process of public schools. The bill will eliminate the Elementary and Education Act of 1965, which is the nation's educational law that provides equal opportunity in education. ESSA is a big comprehensive program that covers programs for struggling learners, advanced and gifted kids in AP classes, ESL classes, classes for minorities such as Native Americans, Rural Education, Education for the Homeless, School Safety (Gun-Free schools), Monitoring and Compliance, and Federal Accountability Programs.\nThe Bill also abolishes the Nutritional Act of 2012 (No Hungry Kids Act) which provides nutritional standards in school breakfast and lunch.\nThe bill has no wording whatsoever protecting Special Needs kids, no mention of IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), and FAPE (Free Appropriate Public Education). Some things ESSA does for Children with Disabilities:\n-Ensures access to the general education curriculum.\n-Ensures access to accommodations on assessments.\n-Ensures concepts of Universal Design for Learning.\n-Includes provisions that require local education agencies to provide evidence-based interventions in schools with consistently underperforming subgroups.\n-Requires states in Title I plans to address how they will improve conditions for learning including reducing incidents of bullying and harassment in schools, overuse of discipline practices and reduce the use of aversive behavioral interventions (such as restraints and seclusion).\nPlease call your representative and ask him/her to vote NO on House Bill 610 (HR 610) introduced by three Republican reps.\nPLEASE copy and paste as I did, don't just share.

It won't make the slighted dent in the issue.\n\nThe important point is that defining people into identity groups, lumping them all together and saying they're all victims who are oppressed and we need to stand up to the evil oppressors, whoever they are, is completely fucking stupid.""",b'Miles Whitaker-Durham',2017-03-29 06:42:32,0

Is it to be expected?\n\nThe difference between the two parties in question is that UKIP were gaining momentum and were a threat to big three. The Green party cannot achieve that and therefore does not get the same media airtime.\n\nIn my humble opinion this is because the Green's lose a lot of credibility with an image (partly justified) of being activists first and politics second. This is reinforced by an appetite to protest on matters that are either trivial or unsound. For example, I was asked to attend a meeting at the concern over the investments being made in water services for Manchester. The Northwest being the centre of excellence for drainage design/management in the world who lead the way in this field. This is like asking apple for a better phone; whilst it is possible it is hardly a vote winner, is it?\n\nI'd love to vote Green, but a) you can't win (so a wasted vote) and b) you appear to waste precious resources fighting the wrong battles sometimes. I think a and b have some overlap.\n\nGoing back to the media coverage question, UKIP are set to implode and hopefully will cease to exist soon. It would be nice to see the Greens pick up those ex Labour/Tory voters but you'd do well to take a leaf from UKIP's book and focus on a few important big issues rather than being activists for activism's sake.""",b'Armin Deshawa',2017-03-28 06:37:04,5

It\'s what the BBC DOESN\'T say or show that is the problem.\n\nFor example, take this HuffPo story: UKIP were on 25% of all Question Time shows over the last 7 years, compared to the Greens\' 7%. For most of that time, UKIP didn\'t have an MP, but the Greens did. UKIP\'s, and particularly Farage\'s, appearances helped to build support for UKIP to the point where they had, at one point, two MPs, and won the 2014 European elections. Had the Greens been granted as many opportunities to express their views, it\'s arguable that they, too, could have built more support than they did. The Greens were almost excluded from the general election debates, and only public pressure got them back in. When Natalie Bennett did appear, it helped the Greens to just over a million votes in the election, the largest vote share they\'ve ever achieved to date.\n\nAnother example is the Unite for Europe march last Saturday. The Met Police estimated 120,000 people attended the march, people from across the UK and Europe, yet the only BBC coverage was a late story buried somewhere on their website and there was no mention on the evening news. However, the BBC saw fit to extensively cover Douglas Carswell leaving UKIP, a move which was obviously and transparently timed by him to take attention away from the protest (why else would he resign on that day in particular, the day of the march and also the 60th anniversary of the European Community?). The march was reported well across European media, but not by the UK\'s national broadcaster.\n\nYou\'ll see a lot of stuff on the BBC and wonder why they\'re showing A or B. However, ask yourself why they\'re not showing C. How many people won\'t even know that C exists because the BBC hasn\'t told them about it? An editor at a magazine I used to work for once told me, ""Sometimes, the things that people don\'t say speak louder than the things they do.""'",b'Alex Wukovich',2017-03-28 10:13:35,13

Acts of terrorism are carried out to gain political leverage. For Islamic terrorism this is to force changes to laws here to more closely resemble that extreme religious way of life, as far as I can tell*. For far-right terrorism it is concerned with closing the borders and removing non-whites from England\'s shores.\n\nIf a terrorist act results in mass public fear, that causes more political leverage. Politicians won\'t negotiate with terrorists, but they will listen to worried voters.\n\n2. Backlash against extremist acts results in an us v them mentality. This makes further retaliations on both sides much more likely.\n\n*notice my use of the words extremist and terrorist. The vast majority of atrocities carried out recently have carried no discernible political message. They aren\'t coordinated acts of terrorism with a goal, but lone wolf or splinter cell attacks carried out to purely to hurt - for ""revenge"" I\'d guess. I\'d classify them as backlash attacks rather than political terrorism. The only way these will reduce is if the sort of people who are likely to commit these acts feel less threatened - and the more air-time we give to the likes of Paul Nuttall, Nigel Farage and Katie ""drown the Syrian toddlers"" Hopkins, the less likely that is to happen.'",b'Jim McMillan',2017-03-25 14:25:47,0

Nuttall\'s comment implies that it is simply a matter of making lackadaisical Muslims finally sort it out, as though the Muslim community haven\'t time and again publicly condemned violence. In reality our political endeavours in the Middle East, our proxy wars, our propping up of Saudi Arabia and the Israeli occupation have done plenty to make the situation worse.

(Definition at http://stochasticterrorism.blogspot.com/ ). Essentially it acknowledges the well understood idea that at any given time there are a large number of people in the world who, given the right stimulus, can be induced to do any given thing. When it's used to make people buy things, it's called advertising. But when pundits or organisations, in the full knowledge of this, make public inflammatory remarks designed to trigger unknown potentially-violent people into violent action, it is terrorism. We know (and if you can't see it after the last few years of news then I can't persuade you of anything) that some proportion of people, generally vulnerable, disturbed people, will respond. So when ISIS make a video calling for lone wolf attacks, this is stochastic terrorism. They KNOW that these videos will result in some number of people being triggered into violence. And in just the same way, the BNP, Britain First, Katie Hopkins etc. KNOW that as a result of their vicious, inflammatory and dehumanising bile, some number of people will be triggered into violence - racist attacks, killings etc. Thomas Mair was one such. That's not to say Mair was without blame of course. But there was some trigger that caused him to set off with a gun that day, apparently Britain First propaganda, and the blame must lie there too, for the act of stochastic terrorism that their propaganda is.""",b'Adrian Knagg-Baugh',2017-03-28 13:57:47,1

There are extremist Christians, extremist white supremacists, random loner extremists like the unabomber, Harold Shipman etc. Lots and lots of people of all creeds and outlooks on life who for whatever reason are unhinged and do violent things as a result. I'm not getting into which religion is more likely to turn people violent: from what I've seen, any religion is capable of being interpreted in a way that calls for violence, but equally so are political ideologies. Some people just have a violent tendency, and they view whatever ideology they are brought up in in a manner that seems to them to require violence. But my point wasn't about the things that drive people to violence, it was about the assumptions made about them afterwards. Take a guy who blows up a whole family in their car. He could be crazy for any reason: it could be a warped view of his religion (whether muslim or not), it could be some mad political belief, he could have a grudge against a woman who rejected his advances. He could just be a lone psycho. But IF he turns out to be a muslim, it will be widely assumed that he blew them up because of his faith, because he was an islamic terrorist, despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of muslims don't go around plotting violent terrorism. IF, on the other hand, he turns out to be a Christian, or of some other faith, or of none, (a) his faith is unlikely to be remarked on at all, and (b) it will not be assumed that he blew them up because of his faith.""",b'Adrian Knagg-Baugh',2017-03-28 13:46:01,1

They are also far more suited and adaptable to local conditions, provide many more local jobs, etc.\n\nThe real argument isn't whether GMOs themselves are safe to eat, it's about whether we a) need them at all and b) want them in the form they would be used in, as Green policy states.
