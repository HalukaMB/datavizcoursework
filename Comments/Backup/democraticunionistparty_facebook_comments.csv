They think they can become the single largest party and nominate a first minister.  Then when the DUP or UUP fail to nominate they will wring their hands in indignation about the Unionist intransigence and failure to work towards the restoration of power sharing.  Please please please DUP and UUP get your heads together and agree who stands where.  Unionists vote according to what the candidates in your constituency ask.

Northern Ireland actually came into being in 1921, before the rest of Ireland seperated from the UK. The Irish state negotiated a seperation by a delegation from the illigitimate Sinn Fein Government. It was then passed by the Sinn Fein cabinate. It was also passed by the illigitimate Government in Dublin, as well as the legitimate Irish Parliament, the UK Westminster Government in Parliament and the UK House of Lords. The Irish Free State certainly had democratic legitimacy but it was not put to a vote for the whole population of the Irish Free State. The Irish Free State came into existance in 1922. Northern Ireland, having already been established with the consent of its people in 1921 was irrelevent to the Irish Free State decision.

I was raised Irish Catholic and I've honestly never talked to a Protestant or even hardly talked to anyone from the north. Doesn't that sound so ignorant of me? I am a little embarrassed haha but this is really exciting for me. So to me Ulster is just a Providence of Ireland, however I imagine it is different to you? Concidering you see it as part of the UK? Walter Graham that is an interesting idea hahaha I guess it would be kind of like what you guys have... I don't know that I would necessarily hate it, however I can't imagine Canada wants to be part of America. Arlene Sloan yes the republic is not there yet. And as to the civil war comment my instinct is to say well certainly, we will get the Brits out by any means necessary however I am trying to look at it differently as it seems there are Irish in the north that like being part of the UK. Which leads me to ask if you consider your selves Irish? See that is very interesting to me because I've always believed that you couldn't possibly be Irish and part of the UK. I've lately talked in length to people in the republic who thought it was an absolutely atrocity for a Republican to vote in why they called a British election.

I'm the only one in my immediate family who really cares to learn about that stuff. I've just never had the oppertunity, when ever I've  met or talked to someone from Ireland they where from the republic and again never wanted to go into politics or anything. I've seen that, certainly agree that the IRA in the 70's 80's where awful. I always believed it was because Britain made them criminals and so they started to act like criminals. As a Republican and a person who hopes for Irish freedom I am very sorry for the way the IRA did things in the more recent years. My thoughts also have been compare 20 or so years of terror from the IRA to the 800 years of terror from England. I think it's easy for me to say we should have unity by any means however I am trying to change that view point and to be honest it was Sinn F\xc3\xa9in who made me start to change that thought.

I talked to someone recently who said that the best sign of unity he'd seen was taking a gaelic class that had some unionist in it and seeing them start to embrace the language and the culture and each other and I thought we might ought to do the same thing. Try to understand where you guys come from because it would be us joining you as much as you joining us and I would want both sides to want the unity otherwise it's not really unity.

I wouldn,t want an all Ireland and be under Rome and also I think we are much better off here but the ballot box is the only answer I go down south quite often and find the Irish people great people who just want to make a living I also think SF played on the Brexit vote as well and there is also more people of different  nationalities here now too.But if an  united  Ireland came about civil war is not the answer'",b'Hetty Davis',2017-03-06 07:38:28,0

I guess all I could say would be well this is where I was born and raised and I have to look at the bright side. Is it the same for the UK I guess? May I ask why you would prefer to be part of the UK, is it economical or cultural or religious? I asked a young man I met who was a law student from Dublin why he thought the north was still separate\xe2\x80\x8b concidering I had to imagine religion isn't as big a factor as it used to be and he said that it was just a matter of that's how things have always been and it's hard for people to change.

As you mentioned I think the fact that Ireland voted for gay marriage is a great example of how Ireland is moving away from the traditional Catholic rule and it made me very excited not just because I support gay rights but also because I see that Ireland is changing and I think that it shows that soon we will be able to accept everyone as the proclamation promised so long ago. Also if you haven't read the Easter proclamation it's really a beautiful document to me I think there are a lot of people in the republic who need to read it and take it to hard there is a beautiful part that talks about equality that I think the world needs to read. In regards to the history I found a good video that explains it on YouTube a brief history of conflicts in the north that seemed to me refreshingly unbiased they didn't mention anything about the potato famine being genocide or the how the English transported a lot of innocent Irish to Australia or sold them as slaves to plantains in the Americas. However the video was good. As for the Brexit I hope for the best for Scotland, Wales and the north. If it's good for you then more power to it as you said we'll have to see what the polls say.

I am very proud of my Irish heritage and I am certain if it wasn't for my Irish blood I wouldn't be half as strong as I am. Furthermore I believe that it is evident god intended Ireland to be one nation by the fact that it is one island. I believe as it was stated in the proclamation that the right to Ireland is to the Irish people that they are equal united and free. That they are undivided by differences fostered by an alien government in the past. I believe in the words of Pearse that Ireland unfree will never be at peace. That's why I am here to try to understand the point of view of the Irish in the north so that when Ireland moves for her freedom I will be educated on what it will take for everyone to feel included. Like I said earlier as someone you supports the fight for a united 32 county Ireland I am very sorry for the way the IRA operated between the 70's and 90's it is regrettable whenever an innocent life is taken. Of course we're still waiting on an apology from England for the millions of lives taken through out history in several nations around the globe including ireland. I do concern myself with my own politics, however we in America aren't under English rule. we took care of that a long time ago! If you are Irish I consider you my sister and friend as I have with Hetty although we have different ideas I greatly respect and appreciate her position and I hope that whatever happens for Ireland in the future is good for her as well as any Irish person north or south, Catholic or Protestant. As is outlined in the proclamation. If you are English it is my opinion that you certainly could feel welcomed in Ireland however should respect the fact that Ireland belongs to the Irish. As I believe anyone should respect that England belongs to the English and Scotland the Scots for that matter. Obviously I have heard of the UK and NI, thank you for your concern though, I do appreciate your thoughtfulness especially concidering our differences. Certainly you have a right to be proud of your heritage as I am mine, and entitled to your opinion as I am as well. Which is that a proud Englishman/woman must be an uneducated Englishman/woman lol. Of course I mean no disrespect and that is just my opinion in a bit of craic. Thank you again for your time and comment.""",b'Roger Fessenden',2017-03-07 22:07:58,0

And hope they never resort to the same behavior.

Without the power of the state Loyalists cannot maintain a majority as Irish Catholics have bigger families, are younger on average, are better educated (more Catholics graduate from Queens than Protestants \xf0\x9f\x98\x82) and also are not wed and defined by crazy traditions like celebrating the victory over your neighbours 400 years after the fact! \n\nNorthern Ireland is a failed state, North and South are better together!

It is time for the individuals in the DUP ranks, who are more interested in personal gain and power, to step aside, and allow true Unionists onto the stage. The rot started with the personal ambition of Ian Paisley, to be the leader of NI, and there was no price too high, to achieve his goal. He was prepared to, and did divide the Unionist community, a division that has deepened over the years. To end up in a situation, as we witnessed in this election, where the leader of the UUP, urged through his actions, for Unionists to transfer votes to a Nationalist party, to further his personal ambition, was akin to Paisley's actions of the past, dividing Unionism. We are now at the last chance saloon, and unless we can recover Unionist unity, with individuals devoid of greed and personal ambition, with a genuine desire to strengthen our position in the Union, we have lost the battle. A strong united Unionist Party, can create a fair society in NI, where everyone, regardless of religious belief, can be proud to live.

McHugh, the Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University and former psychiatrist\xe2\x80\x93in-chief for Johns Hopkins Hospital has just dropped a bomb on Obama, liberals and transgenders.\n\nDr. McHugh, who has studied transgendered people for 40 years, said it is a scientific fact that ""transgendered men do not become women, nor do transgendered women become men.""\n\nMichael W. Chapman at CNS News has more:\n\nAll such people, Dr. McHugh explained in an article for The Witherspoon Institute,  ""become feminized men or masculinized women, counterfeits or impersonators of the sex with which they \'identify.\'""\n\nDr. McHugh, who was psychiatrist-in-chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital for 26 years, the medical institute that had initially pioneered sex-change surgery \xe2\x80\x93 and later ceased the practice \xe2\x80\x93 stressed that the cultural meme, or idea that ""one\'s sex is fluid and a matter of choice"" is extremely damaging, especially to young people.\n\nThe idea that one\'s sexuality is a feeling and not a biological fact ""is doing much damage to families, adolescents, and children and should be confronted as an opinion without biological foundation wherever it emerges,"" said Dr. McHugh in his article.\n\n""Both the state and federal governments are actively seeking to block any treatments that can be construed as challenging the assumptions and choices of transgendered youngsters.""\n\nHe points out what senior adviser to President Obama, Valerie Jarrett said- ""As part of our dedication to protecting America\'s youth, this administration supports efforts to ban the use of conversion therapy for minors.""\n\nThink about that for a second. Obama doesn\'t want these kids to get the help they need and wants the government to control what happens. It\'s insane.\n\nDr. McHugh says those who want to change their gender suffer from a psychological condition rather than a biological matter.\n\n""In fact, gender dysphoria\xe2\x80\x94the official psychiatric term for feeling oneself to be of the opposite sex\xe2\x80\x94belongs in the family of similarly disordered assumptions about the body, such as anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder,"" said McHugh.\n\n""Its treatment should not be directed at the body as with surgery and hormones any more than one treats obesity-fearing anorexic patients with liposuction,"" he said.\n\nMichele Hickford at Allen B. West has more:\n\nPerhaps the most tragic part of this new trend is the consequence. After the immense pain and hardship of transitioning, a high percentage of transgendered individuals eventually take their own lives.\n\nWhen ""the tumult and shouting dies,"" McHugh continued, ""it proves not easy nor wise to live in a counterfeit sexual garb. The most thorough follow-up of sex-reassigned people\xe2\x80\x94extending over 30 years and conducted in Sweden, where the culture is strongly supportive of the transgendered\xe2\x80\x94documents their lifelong mental unrest.""\n\n""Ten to 15 years after surgical reassignment, the suicide rate of those who had undergone sex-reassignment surgery rose to 20 times that of comparable peers,"" said McHugh.\n\nI will probably get hammered by our liberal readers for apparently ""trivializing"" this issue, but here I go anyway\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nWhen I was growing up in the \'70\'s there was a TV commercial for Chiffon margarine, which apparently tasted just like butter\xe2\x80\xa6but it\'s not. The very last (and very famous) line from the commercial was ""It\'s not nice to fool Mother Nature.""\n\nApparently that is still the case.\n\nSpot on.\n\nFolks, Obama has done so much damage to our nation that it\'s going to take one hell of a strong president to get our country back on track.\n\nThe only person that can pull us out of this is Donald Trump.\n\nGod Bless.\n\nI VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN'",b'Earl Hand',2017-02-26 15:42:45,1

""So it\'s a week since I posted my passionate primary political rant with all my views on the election and I have since been embroiled in some banter, debate and discussion with people I don\'t know.\nOk. I admit I\'m voting Alliance but I have been posting some thought provoking comments on both the SF/ DUP facebook page, nothing negative, just asking questions, promoting ideas, alternatives\xe2\x80\xa6  They are the parties I have issues with.  Of note I have been putting DUP supporters minds at rest as they seem to be obsessed with impending unification (eg one poor old lady stated SF number one and only priority was a united Ireland) So I was able to reply to her quoting their manifesto of which it is one vague paragraph. I reminded her that UK and RoI would have to agree and it was years away.(She will be long gone!) I suggested she consider other parties if she was voting out of fear now I have assuaged her worry.  Imagine my surprise, my confusion, my anger when yesterday when I went looking for her feedback I find that every single comment I had ever made on the DUP facebook was removed and I was not longer permitted to comment on their page!!!!!\nThat in itself is pretty outrageous but what is worse is the DUP are happy to leave vile and nasty comments from nationalists about the party leader, calling her a pig, about her short hair, clothes, etc\xe2\x80\xa6 they are happy to leave comments from nationalists ""our day is coming/ SF first minister/ United Ireland"" \nThey leave all the comments from their supporters warning not to split the unionist vote\xe2\x80\xa6"" If you don\'t vote DUP youll get a SF first minister"" They leave nasty comments from supporters about how useless the UUP are.\nMY QUESTION- why leave all that negativity but remove my questions and neutral commentary?\nMY (SUGGESTED) ANSWER- I believe it is an extension of their manifesto \xe2\x80\x93 a campaign built on scaring people to vote for them through fear of what might happen if they don\'t vote for them. \nI appreciate it is their site and their control, but surely this is censorship and control, in fact what they are leaving behind is cleverly disguised propaganda. Can their members not be trusted to consider other options? Is this North Korea?\nIf you know of DUP supporters who might like to open their minds please share, talk to, or encourage because this doesn\'t seem fair or right to me. How do we at least talk to these people and get the debate off the ground ?\nFreedom of Expression\xe2\x80\xa6..NO WAIT\xe2\x80\xa6.

I did not imply that he was the operating commander of any terrorist group. \nThere is incontrovertible evidence of his toxic hate speech and actions as part of the various paramilitary organisations that he formed or was involved with. These include the Ulster Protestant Action, the Ulster Protestant Volunteers, Third force and the Ulster Resistance. \n\nDo you not know anything about Northern Irish history? This is all well documented, the speeches, pictures and film footage is all available online. I will give you a few examples to illustrate my point and you can decide if you still think that he was not responsible for inciting any violence or stirring sectarian tensions. I do however suggest that you do a bit more thorough reading about this.\n\nAs part of the UPA, he was responsible for naming the addresses of catholic businesses and homes during a rally. These were later attacked and burnt out and 'taigs out' painted on their walls. He was also involved in campaigning for catholic families to be denied access to social housing. \nHe formed the UPV, many of whose members were also in the UVF and who attended each other's marches and rallies. He publicly thanked the UVF for attending a march in 1966, shortly after which they launched an indiscrimate campaign of petrol bombing catholic homes and murdering innocent Catholics. \nIn 1968 he roused a rabble of 500 men with cudgels to counter a civil rights march in Armagh. \nHe was the main thrust of a workers strike which was aimed at paralysing the whole country for 2 weeks in 1974 in opposition to the sunningdale agreement. The strikers targeted fellow protestants who refused to stop working and culminated in loyalists bombing in Dublin and Monaghan, killing 33 innocent people. He later organised another strike in 1977, boasting that he had personally taken part in the patrols during a speech in Westminster. During this strike a loyalist bus driver was murdered for continuing to work and A UDR soldier was killed in a bomb targeted at a petrol station for staying open. \n\nNeed I go on? (there is a LOT more)\n\nThe point is, it stinks of hypocrisy for the DUP to go on saying that we need to teach our children that terrorism was never justified, when Paisley himself was responsible for inspiring some of that terrorism. \n\nYou keep going back to mentioning other groups, who no doubt were at times equally or more responsible for the wrongs of the past. They seem to be trying to move forward. More than can be said for the DUP who Just want to keep dragging everyone back into the 'them and us' default setting.

That's not to mention the trillions they will have to pay back, or the 77 billion they lost extra on top of the other loses in the autumn statement.

My mistrust in other unionist parties came from the treatment they gave to their loyal electorate - of which I was one, around the time the GFA was signed. That trust, I'm afraid is lost and will never be regained,no matter how badly the DUP may have treated the MLA you refer to.

The DUP capitalise on fear. It is such a shame. I have friends in England who, sometimes talk to me about NI politics - they regularly ask about our social/moral 'backwardness' (their words); this makes me embarrassed as no country in the 21st century should be denying marriage equality, denying the woman's right to choose and the outright and blatant subversion of democracy by way of abuse of PoC.

I agree with you to a certain degree we do not need religion in our politics unfortunately that has to come from all sections of the community so please spare me your disappointment about a conversation about abortion which ultimately brought the subject of religion into what was a political conversation. If you look carefully you will see - I didn't mention Roman Catholics anywhere until that point. When the significant majority of both religions here ditch there religion  then maybe we will get the Northern Ireland you and people like you want. By the way .... it was the RC church who denied it's people contraception, it actively asked women when would they be starting a family and if not, why not and although not how I would describe Roman Catholics living in Ireland there was some truth in the thinking of the man who formed the DUP.

Likening the party to a crocodile is a great way of showing respect during the lead up to an election. Its complete hypocrisy, ignoring the mandate for and Irish Language Act that the DUP agreed upon by signing the Saint Andrews Agreement. Nelson McCausland stating to Stephen Nolan that the DUP didn\'t pay attention to ""the fine print"" is almost hilarious if it is in fact true. If the figures of \xc2\xa3100m per year are accurate and not distorted to suit ones own agenda, then clearly that is far too much to implement the act in full. Though literally burning hundreds of millions of pounds via the RHI scheme due to the naivety and idiocy of the DUP is perfectly acceptable. Every party has a responsibility to the entire electorate, so to politicise an indigenous language simply to deflect attention from your own failings is not an admirable trait.

All I'm asking is how are Alliance going to change what's happening? How are Alliance going to convince me to vote for them ? How will they take the fear and mistrust away from loyalists ( unionists) and nationalists ( republicans) and convince them they would be better off just trusting that Alliance will turn us from fervently caring about our identity to being these little stepford wives types who all want the same thing ? I want to vote for someone who lives in the real world. Yes we want peace yes we want a government where there's no corruption but let's face it what country people n the world doesn't ? How many countries have it ? None !!! I have voted DUP since they've been around. But I'm so fed up so let down by the rolling over and playing dead to SF I really want an alternative. But what I want doesn't exist in our country. I want a party that says. We have to share power with SFIRA but we have the PUL communities back !!! We will Keep Ulster British. We will give the nationalists ( republicans ) the right to call themselves Irish but we will not give them an Irish Ulster. I've said over and over that the people in this (my) wee country are the only ones who care about it. Both sides Love this country. If they didn't the loyalists would move to the mainland and the nationalists ( republicans) would move to Ireland. But the mistrust is enormous and that's the reason no matter how much we crave change we won't get it. Because neither side trusts the other to vote for it. I wanted to know what in this country is the most important question which country is Alliance loyal too ? Britain or Ireland? That's all. But instead your going on about corruption. Which by the way your accusing people off without waiting for the outcome of the inquiry which to give her her dues Mrs. Foster has welcomed. \nSo either tell me how Alliance are going to bring the two communities together and how that would work in a power sharing government? Or admit you don't know. I'd love a viable alternative but can I just say I'd never vote Alliance with Naomi Long as their leader anyway.

We simply don't have what it takes for a new beginning. We don't have the caliber and the mechanism to form any kind of ruling party in Northern Ireland. We tried it with NI 21 and some very right minded people who had vision. And what happened two former Unionist  fools destroyed it before it ever got off the ground. And during the election did the people vote for them .No they voted again for sectarian politics which has left us in the mess we are now in. Sinn Fein really do not have the interest of the Northern Irish people at heart and are out to rule Ireland as a republican identity. I feel sorry for some members of the DUP who are very hard working people and who genuinely look after their local constituents. But covering up the scandals now upon us leaves a lot to be desired. They all now can't make any excuses they have failed and why have they failed. Because if the truth is to be told they really don't like each other as Sinn Fein are not prepared to rule NI with the DUP as a separate  identity from the rest of Ireland.

Nancy Pelosi announced she will appoint Rep Andre Carson, D-Ind,\nas the first Muslim lawmaker on the House of Representatives Permanent\nSelect Committee on Intelligence. It would make Carson the first Muslim to\nserve on the committee that receives intelligence on the threat of Islamic\nmilitants in the Middle East! He has suggested\n\nthat U.S. schools should be modeled after Islamic madrassas, where\neducation is based on the Quran!!!\n\nAnd last but not least, our closet Muslim himself, Barack Hussein Obama.\n\nIt\'s questionable if Obama ever officially took the oath of office when he\nwas sworn in. He didn\'t repeat the oath properly to defend ournation and\nour Constitution. Later the Democrats claimed he was given the oath again\nin private.\n\nCIA director John Brennan took his oath on a copy of the Constitution, not\na Bible..??\n\nValarie Jarret wrote her college thesis on how she wanted to change America\ninto a Muslim friendly nation and she is a Obama top advisor.\n\nCongressman, Keith Ellison took his oath on a copy of the Qur\'an.\n\nCongresswoman Michele Bachman was vilified and verbally tarred and\nfeathered by Democrats when she voiced her concern about Muslims taking\nover our government.\n\nConsidering all these appointments, it would explain why Obama and his\nminions are systematically destroying our nation, supporting radical Muslim\ngroups worldwide, opening our southern border, and turning a blind eye to\nthe genocide being perpetrated on Christians all over Africa and the Middle\nEast.\n\nThe more damage Obama does, the more arrogant he\'s become!\n\nOur nation and our government has been infiltrated by people who want to\ndestroy us. It can only get worse!\n\nIf you fail to pass this one on, there\'s something wrong.. Somewhere!\n\nIn his book he said, ""if it comes down to it, I would side with the\nMuslims"". (And still, some insist he isn\'t Muslim!)\n\nCommon sense doesn\'t grow in everyone\'s garden.'",b'Stephen Jones',2016-10-28 17:53:12,2

Trump all the way! \n\nIf you\'re under 50 you really need to read this. If you\'re over 50, you lived through it, so share it with those under 50. Amazing to me how much I had forgotten!When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn\'t even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood \xe2\x80\x93 both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno \xe2\x80\x93 husband Bill described her selection as ""my worst mistake."" Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovery of Ms. Guanier\'s radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration.Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.Many younger votes will have no knowledge of ""Travelgate."" Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson \xe2\x80\x93 and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were:She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr\'s investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary\'s game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for \'lying under oath\' to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, ""I do not recall,"" ""I have no recollection,"" and ""I don\'t know"" a total of 56 times while under oath.After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen.Now we are exposed to the destruction of possibly incriminating emails while Hillary was Secretary of State and the ""pay to play"" schemes of the Clinton Foundation \xe2\x80\x93 we have no idea what shoe will fall next. But to her loyal fans (supporters) - I guess in her own words ""what difference does it make?"" I guess being a female Democrat is all that matters.

EU uses your and Britains money to give to other countries like Romania, Bulgaria and Greece. You pay for road works in Greece?!!?!\nEU is also for bringing in refugees in millions to the European continent and most of these people will not get jobs in that partical country in Europe that they come to and they will not be a part of the normal life in Europe. Most of them will not pay taxes, because they will not get jobs, the will live in slumareas in Europe, also Britain. That is not good for Europe. The immigration from outside of Europe and also within the EU is not beneficial for Europe and Britain. The british society have a big unemployment figure and Britain needs all the jobs we can get. As it is now, thousands and thousand of people from EU is coming to Britain to work. Nothing wrong with that, you might think, but it is a problem; these migrants take jobs that could have gone to the british unemployed people. EU itself is a big, big industri of politicians, you might call it. Thousand of politicians and administration-workers make a lot of money in EU and the parlament of EU and all the offices around there cost a fortune for the countries of EU, inkluding Britain. The economics of EU has been a disaster. To be out of EU therefor better than being in. If Britain leaves EU, Britain can easily trade with the EU-countries and countries outside EU.

Within Britain it is clear that strong majorities exist for remaining in the EU in Scotland and in Northern Ireland and to a lesser extent in Wales. Digging deeper, London wishes strongly to remain and the rest of England slightly to strongly negative. Poor little England.\n\nWhat is astonishing is that, in England, those regions that are least affected by the migration which is portrayed as the catalyst of this crisis, are the most vehement in their refusal to consider reasoned argument on the subject. London, a vibrant and international city, full of migrants, is the most positive part of England in favour of remaining in Europe. Despite the 2011 census showing its ethnic makeup is less than 45% British (which includes Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland), far from feeling threatened by diversity, the English capital clearly does not share UKIPs view that England would be better off out. This most densely populated part of England does not feel there is a lack of space or jobs and does not see its culture threatened by migrants. Comparing the capital to the rural counties from where distressing reports of the abuse of migrant workers emerge regularly, we already have a feeling that the contradictory views and behaviour of the leave-shires lack morality whichever way we look at them.\n\nThe antics of Boris Johnson who has, with great energy to give him his due, taken over from the political fringe occupied by the failed UKIP party in flying the Leave flag and are an embarrasment. The unavoidable comparisons with the other blonde mop-top go deeper than dodgy hair styles. While Trump is out to buy the US presidency with money and barely disguised gung-ho racism, Johnson, having lost his position as Mayor of London clearly sees an opportunity in the Leave campaign to challenge for ladership of the Tory party and a path to being Prime Minister. That alone should be enough to ring alarm bells regarding his judgement of whats best for Britain.\n\nThe narrow education that is typical in English schools, where the majority of young people do not learn a foreign language, or economics, or geography, or history to the A levels, creates a fertile ground for those who wish to spread untruth, myths and outrageous lies about the European project. It is imperfect. So is the British take on democracy. But it has delivered peace, growth, freedom of movement and human rights. It is has had a mondernising and positive influence on every country it has touched. Yes there are differences of approach and views and yes it sometimes takes years to arrive at less than perfect compromises. But it does achiecve that, where otherwise there would be nothing.\n\nIf the UK drops out of Europe, where will the Foreign Direct Investment to Britain go? We can expect a certain amount to go there regardless, but a large part of that investment is prdicated on the UK providing access to the EU market with tarifs or trade barriers. It is also predicated on the current situation where the pound does not swing wildly relative to the Euro. Ireland and the Netherlands seem likely targets for companies. As the OECD reports, (http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/FDI-in-Figures-April-2016.pdf) ""OECD FDI inflows almost doubled compared to 2014, most ly due to large inflows in Ireland, the Netherlands , Switzerland and the United States . Investors from those countries were also responsible for the 35 % increase in OECD outflows. These countries appear among the top destinations and top sources of FDI worldwide in 2015."" It cannot be a good thing for the UK to become less attractive as a destination for investment just as it chooses to go it alone.\n\nAnd that\'s the nub of it. If Britain votes to leave the EU, they will be alone. Remaining a member of NATO will not keep people in jobs, or ensure British exports have free access to the single biggest market in the world. Everyone who\'s opinion is based on science rather than emotion agrees from UK based business leaders, politicans from all parties except UKIP and the DUP, trade unions, economic forecasters and academics. The wider world\'s most respected and influential economic organisations and leaders are of one voice - to leave would be anything from foolish to disastrous. Even President Obama, who\'s office would not usually pronounce on such sovereign discussions has made clear that this would damage the UKs position with the US. In fact, internationally, the US mop-head Trump appears to be Johnson\'s only ally there. How long before he suggests that he will flood the Channel Tunnel and make the French pay for it? Even the citizens of Europe are, in every other EU country positive they want the UK to remain.\n\nJohnson\'s charge that there is a \'democratic void\' in Europe is worth discussing, but so to is the faulty democracry present in many EU states, the UK included, where winning as little as 38% of the vote can lead to overwhelming majorities in our nations parliaments. That is a subject for another day. For now, let us hope that the young, the educated, the Londoners, the Scots, the Welsh, the Northern Irish, the Irish, Cypriots and Maltese in Britain all come out in vast numbers because they are the ones who can ensure a positive result for Britain, for Ireland and for Europe - a continent united.\n\nIf you know anyone with a vote - encourage them to vote to remain.\nAnything else would be very bad for the UK.\n\nTDH'",b'Dublin Hack',2016-06-04 21:05:45,2

It is not something that happens TO us. We are major players. In practice, nothing happens within the EU to which we are not party.\n6. We have two years to sever ties with the EU, in the event of an exit win. But future relations with the EU is a separate thing in terms of things like trade, travel, and legal agreements. EU legal experts say typically it takes at least ten years just to get to a basic agreement. \n7. The ""Norwegian Model"" of EU market membership without EU membership is not necessarily available to us. Even if it is, it is very expensive. We will have a huge number of rules to follow without any ability to influence what those rules are.   \n8. It is completely beyond doubt that a vote to leave the EU we will terminate ALL trade agreements with countries out-with the EU, as those were negotiated via the EU. This will entail renegotiating around 70 trade agreements.\n9.
