Trust the BBC to push that nonsense.\nWe aren\'t an economy reliant on Oil, we supply an excess of food and drink (fish alone accounts for 60% of the entire UK and 20% of Europe) and that\'s just for a start.\nTo top it all off, Venezuela\'s Oil and economy has been badly mismanaged and the USA is pretty much at War with South American Oil producers and has been purposefully pushing prices down, that\'s why they are in difficulty.\n\nThe UK is still 100% in control of the UK Oil industry as well, never created an Oil fund and is alone in the world in *subsidising* Oil companies to pump out Oil, rather than charge significant taxes. Mismanagement at its worst!'",b'Ming Kerr',2017-04-10 09:58:12,2

The comments of a fool, the author, and you for repeating it.\n\nScotland is a NATION, and Shetland is Scottish territory. This is established in LAW. Upon independence, even if Shetland voted against indy, Shetland would be part of the newly independent Scotland.\n\nHaving said that, I couldn't see in the future an independent Scottish government being so belligerent regarding potential Shetland independence as the UK is towards Scotland.

That is complex and means they need to pass new laws and build the required infrastructure so that the Scottish Government can deliver the benefits instead of the DWP. As 1.4 million people rely on these benefits they have to make sure they get that in place and get it right for them \xe2\x80\x93 ensuring that everyone reliant on benefits receives the money to which they are entitled on the day when it is due. That's why they have always been clear that the safe and secure transition of the devolved benefits is an absolute priority. They will protect disability benefits, not cut them, and will ensure that they remain non-means tested.and establish a Scottish Social Security Agency with dignity and respect at its heart(bye bye Atos)! During the time that benefits are being transferred to Scotland, any child in receipt of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) will be given an automatic award of that DLA to age 18 unless they don't want it. This will allow for continuity for families whilst the transfer of benefits takes place. They will also bring back long term awards for those with long term conditions or disabilities establishing a Disability Benefits Assessment Commission to provide recommendations and guidance on how often assessments should be, what conditions should be given an automatic or lifetime awards, and eligibility criteria.(again bye Atos)! In addition, the rate of Carer's Allowance will e raised to the same level as Jobseeker's Allowance, giving carers an extra \xc2\xa3600 each year. To recognise higher costs of living, they will also increase Carer's Allowance further for those looking after more than one disabled child, as well as extending Winter Fuel Payments to families who have severely disabled children.They will also abolish the 84 day-rule, which currently means that severely ill or disabled children needing more than 84 days hospitalisation or medical treatment lose both Disability Living Allowance and Carer's Allowance.

In March 2017 the DWP informed her that she was being stripped of her disability benefits after a snap reassessment of her benefits claim had found that she does not need her motability car in order to live independently.\n\nAfter taking advice from her local MP Jan turned to the DWP\'s Access to Work scheme, which subsequently awarded her \xc2\xa365,133.71 over the course of three years in order to pay for taxis to and from work!\n\nIn order to save the \xc2\xa36,000 it would have cost to let Jan keep her motability car the Tory administered DWP are willing to shell out over ten times the amount on paying taxis to chauffeur her to and from work!\n\nThis is astounding stuff from the Tories. They love to dress themselves up as ""the party of economic competence"", but this case makes it look like their campaign of confiscating an average of 800 motability cars a week is motivated more by malice than any intention to actually save money.\n\nThe ridiculous decision to snatch Jan\'s motability car to save less than \xc2\xa36,000 and then stump up over \xc2\xa365,000 for taxis also makes a mockery of the Tories absurd ""making work pay"" rhetoric too. The only people this farce seems to be making work pay for are the taxi companies of Ayrshire.\n\nThis farcical situation is far from the only example of Tories creating ridiculous false economies. Back in 2010 the Tory environment minister Caroline Spelman decided to save money by slashing flood defence spending, despite the evidence showing that every \xc2\xa31 spent on flood defences saves \xc2\xa38 in future economic damage. Over the next few years various parts of the UK to be hit by huge floods, including places that had their flood defence renewal schemes cancelled by Spelman\'s bonkers austerity cuts. In August 2016 she was rewarded for this lunacy with a DBE!\n\nIt\'s also worth remembering that various other aspects of the Tories\' welfare reforms cost way more than they save. The demeaning, dehumanising and discriminatory Work Capacity Assessment regime costs way more in corporate outsourcing fees than it can ever possibly save in reduced benefits payments, and the Tories\' savage sanctions regime also costs way more to administer than it saves in reduced welfare payments.\n\nJan is just one amongst tens of thousands of disabled people who have had their motability cars confiscated by the Tories. Given their outrageous track record of wasting taxpayers money on malicious and misguided schemes it would take wilful ignorance to excuse this case as an isolated case of incompetence, and a great deal of gullibility to continue believing in the myth of Tory economic competence.'",b'William Dunbar',2017-04-10 07:15:10,4

It's also where many of our tourists and international students come from.\n\nThose are just some of the reasons it's important that we continue to build good relationships in the US and promote Scotland as a place to live, work, invest and visit. It's part of my job to make sure we take every opportunity to build on those links.\n\nOver the last week in California and New York, I've met with representatives of some of our key current investors, and potential new investors, to ensure they know how committed we are to building a strong economy, and to remaining an open and welcoming country against the backdrop of Brexit.\n\nWe have long had strong interest from US companies in our financial services sector, but increasingly there's interest in our technology sectors too.\n\nEdinburgh had more tech start-ups per head than London in 2015 - and we want that to keep going.\n\nOne of the most exciting discussions I took part in was at Stanford University \xe2\x80\x93 who are working in partnership with five Scottish universities to expose science and technology students to the entrepreneurial environment of Silicon Valley, encouraging them to turn problem solving science into profitable businesses.\n\nWhilst there I met with one investment company, Par Equity, who are putting $125 million into an investment fund to bring health technology start ups to Scotland and take Scottish start ups to the US market.\n\nMy visit wasn't just about inward investment in Scotland, it was also about helping Scottish companies into the American market.\n\nAnd in a few weeks 12 female CEOs of Scottish firms will be landing in California to make their pitches to some of the investors I met, to try to secure the funding they need to grow their businesses at home and sell their products in the US.\n\nThis focus on technology is vital for the future of Scotland's economy.\n\nIndeed, following my announcement a few weeks ago that the Scottish Government will be investing \xc2\xa336 million in supporting businesses to improve the digital skills of their staff, I took a look at The Flat Iron School, a training programme in New York City that helps people into technology jobs \xe2\x80\x93 exactly the kind of programme we will be investing in here at home.\n\nBut our economy isn't just about the science and technology. Our natural assets \xe2\x80\x93 food and drink, gorgeous scenery and inspiring history \xe2\x80\x93 are also hugely important.\n\nSo it was exciting to hear from Marriot Hotels about their plans to build seven new hotels in Scotland to meet growing demand from visitors to our shores, and also to join TripAdvisor and Visit Scotland at the Carnegie Hall to announce their partnership \xe2\x80\x93 a European first \xe2\x80\x93 to promote Scotland as a place to visit.\n\nAnd it's always a pleasure to promote Scotland's food and drink industry, which achieved over $1 billion of food and drink exports to the US last year \xe2\x80\x93 a figure that is set to grow.\n\nPromoting Scotland overseas is a central part of being First Minister and as I've travelled across the US this week it's clear to me there's a big appetite for all that Scotland has to offer...""","b""Margaret O'Donnell""",2017-04-10 06:30:15,11

That premise has now been removed due to the overall UK Brexit result. \nBased on this new information, in addition to the fact that the majority vote in Scotland was to remain within the EU, a second referendum on independence is now required  in order to finally ascertain the Scottish people\'s decision on whether to go independent with a view to remaining in the EU or to stay in the UK and exit the EU.  \nWith regards to the point about the ""ugly aspects of nationalism"", the people of all nation states in every part of the world should have and need the right to decide for themselves on whether they want to part of a greater union or confederation or whether they would prefer to be independent entities. \nNationalism, per se, does not automatically mean it is associated with or described by the adjective ""ugly"" (although, yes, there are certain individuals who do have strident agendas, but they do not necessarily represent the majority opinion).  \nPersonally, I do not subscribe to the notion that First Minister Sturgeon is an example of an ""ugly aspect of nationalism""; there are far, far worse examples of such. \nHowever, we all have the right to our own viewpoints and opinions and these are an endemic and necessary part of any and all healthy democracies; reasoned and respectful debate, together with acting upon the people\'s majority decisions, are the keystones to resolving such disagreements.

The German national parliament often makes a bill with far less time debatting and believe me, the German system is more complex then the UK one (since we are an federal state). \n\nRegarding the budget, it would be nice if you post a direct source. \n\nBtw. this nationalcentric view about EU students is not very wise. First of all, such students often stay in a country. They are overproportionally people who found companies. Second, your scottish people also get free university in other countries. If you think, that the Scots can prosper in a narrow world, that will not happen. \n\nThere is a saying from Oscar Wilde and it is most fitting to politics. \n""The simple and pure truth, \nis rarely simple\nand never pure.

Are you saying you are the only one who can tell the difference?  It doesn't look like it from some of your comments. You mentioned money being a problem but don't say in what way. Scotlands economy is one of the top economies in the world, way way above many countries who manage perfectly well on their own. So on that bases where is your argument centred on. The UK's deficit is way higher than it should be and only by borrowing more and more money can the UK gov balance the books. That borrowing is growing daily and the cost of paying it back not manageable if it gets out of hand. When the Tories took over, the UK's borrowing was around \xc2\xa3900 Billion not its at \xc2\xa31.7Trillion and rising at an astronomical rate. By 2022, they say it will be over \xc2\xa32Trillion pounds. Scotland can't borrow, it gets an 'allowance' each year, The Block Grant and the UK get more from the Scottish economy than we gets back. As soon as independence is agreed after the vote for it, Scotland will inherit \xc2\xa3190Billion as their part of the share of the UK assets, which are rightly ours. We would have no debt, 95% of the oil and with getting rid of Trident, we'd not only have the massive oil fields off Shetland but also the equally large one in the Clyde estuary. We would manage the oil much better than the Uk has and not let the big oil companies off with paying tax as the UK has done, we in the UK's don't make much out of oil, not because it's not worth anything but that the UK gov has let off the big oil companies, making them richer. Norway didn't let them off, they taxed the oil companies and made sure they did which saw them make over \xc2\xa346 Billion more than the UK made in the same timescale. Same price, same costs.\nSo money isn't a problem as you suggest.""",b'David MacPherson',2017-04-09 14:43:18,5

If you\'d ever heard a case of someone losing their life, home or job due to the sole fact that they\'re heterosexual, then you could argue for ""heterosexual rights"", otherwise you just come across as petty and ridiculous. Thankfully, these things aren\'t known to happen to LGBT people in our country, because of the rights protections we have here, hence why they\'re valid and important. The reason the SNP brag about this is because other countries are woefully behind; When you can find videos online of heterosexuals being scalped, burned and beaten simply because of their orientation (as is what often happens to transgender and gay people in Brazil, for example) then you can argue for this myth that is the oppression of heterosexuals on an international level! \xf0\x9f\x8c\x9f Progress is linear, and it started with straight people marginalising LGBT people, not the other way around. ""Oh look at me"", knowing basic sociological, political history.\n\nI agree with everything you stand for besides this. I too think more focus needs to be shifted onto poverty and economical issues. But your disregarding of this issue as attention-seeking drama is grossly misinformed, and even obnoxious; SNP keep crying about this kind of progress, because it\'s a crowd pleaser for the younger generations, and also basic human rights (such as freedom from discrimination) are worthy of celebration, wouldn\'t you think? Of course, I encourage you to continue pushing for more economic policy from the SNP - this is also always a good thing. There\'s no need for negativity towards other issues. You can ""get on with it"" without that.\n\n(Sorry for the essay, but seeing as you spent much of this thread insulting the intelligence of others, I thought you\'d appreciate it.)'",b'Katie Anderson',2017-04-09 15:30:43,3

Almost half of that sum came from one man: Ian Taylor, a long-term Conservative Party donor and Chief Executive of oil-traders Vitol plc.\nToday\'s Sunday Herald described Taylor as ""a Scots oil trader with a major stake in the Harris Tweed industry"". They also gave Taylor\'s views \xe2\x80\x93 who is reportedly worth \xc2\xa3155 million \xe2\x80\x93 print space to justify his funding decision.\nThis raises several concerns. Taylor, according to The Sunday Herald, is not registered to vote in Scotland. This breaks Electoral Commission guidelines for general elections, which Yes Scotland has promised to follow. Secondly, Ian Taylor has given \xc2\xa3550,000 to the Conservative Party since 2006. This is a further case of Tory donors \xe2\x80\x93 and their political interests \xe2\x80\x93 bankrolling the \'no\' campaign.\nThese general complaints, however, are minor in comparison to more serious incidents \xe2\x80\x93 unmentioned in the media today \xe2\x80\x93 linked to Ian Taylor\'s business background.\nWhile Chief Executive of Vitol plc, his company has been involved in shady-deals in Serbia, Iraq, Libya and Iran. Furthermore, Vitol avoided tax to the tune of millions of pounds through an offshore trading scheme. Douglas Alexander, Labour\'s Shadow Foreign Secretary, described Vitol\'s relationship with Westminster as ""curious"", and said there were questions to answer.\nAs Chief Executive of Vitol since 1995, Ian Taylor has serious questions to answer in all of these cases. Better Together have serious questions to answer as to what they knew about Ian Taylor before they accepted half-a-million pounds from him. Alistair Darling \xe2\x80\x93 who recently met with Taylor prior to the funding deal \xe2\x80\x93 must also confirm what his position is on the following cases.'",b'Rosina Cargill',2017-04-09 18:26:47,1

This undercut the UN oil-for-food program \xe2\x80\x93 1996-2003 \xe2\x80\x93 that sought to trade Iraqi energy resources for humanitarian supplies.\nWas Ian Taylor aware of his company\'s actions at the time? To what extent did his company profit from these deals in Iraq and to what extent did he profit personally from the company\'s success? Is Better Together content to accept Mr Taylor as a major funder in these circumstances? Vitol has aknowledged that some payments were made outside the scope of the U.N. oil-for-food program to the National Iraqi Oil Company and have chosen to describe these payments as ""surcharges"" rather than ""bribes or kickbacks"".\n\xc2\xa7 155.40 Grand larceny in the second degree.\nA person is guilty of grand larceny in the second degree when he steals property and when:\n1. The value of the property exceeds fifty thousand dollars; or\n2. The property, regardless of its nature and value, is obtained by extortion committed by instilling in the victim a fear that the actor or another person will (a) cause physical injury to some person in the future, or (b) cause damage to property, or (c) use or abuse his position as a public servant by engaging in conduct within or related to his official duties, or by failing or refusing to perform an official duty, in such manner as to affect some person adversely. Grand larceny in the second degree is a class C felony.\nAt the time of the guilty plea the State Prosecutor Morgenthau said in a statement \xe2\x80\x93 ""One outcome of this investigation,\xe2\x80\xa6 is to insure that illegal funds that were paid to Saddam Hussein\'s government are redirected to benefit the Iraqi people"" \n3) Ian Taylor\'s Company Avoided Tax \'for more than a decade\'\nVitol plc employed the controversial tax avoidance scheme known as \'Employee Benefit Trusts\'. (EBTs) Such schemes allowed employees to avoid paying income tax and companies to avoid national insurance contributions. Vitol used the scheme \'for more than a decade\'.\nTax evasion and avoidance costs the UK Exchequer tens of billions of pounds a year. EBTs were banned in 2011. Vitol then entered negotiations with HMRC over claims that it still owed millions of pounds in unpaid taxes.\nWhat did Ian Taylor know about the company\'s tax avoidance scheme? Even if it met legal requirements, does he consider tax avoidance to be morally just? Is Better Together aware of these claims against the company of its major donor? Vitol state their tax arrangements are legal.\n4) Ian Taylor has been accused of improper political donations to the Conservative Party.\nAccording to today\'s Sunday Herald, Ian Taylor has donated \xc2\xa3550,000 to the Conservative Party since 2006. He was one of the 70 millionaires who paid the \xc2\xa350,000 privilege to join David Cameron\'s Leaders Group. Leaders Group membership led, in many cases, to a private dinner with the Prime Minister, which Taylor attended in Downing Street on November 2nd 2011.

Grand larceny in the second degree is a class C felony.\nAt the time of the guilty plea the State Prosecutor  Morgenthau said in a statement \xe2\x80\x93 ""One outcome of this investigation,\xe2\x80\xa6 is to insure that illegal funds that were paid to Saddam Hussein\'s  government are redirected to benefit the Iraqi people"" \n3) Ian Taylor\'s Company Avoided Tax \'for more than a decade\'\nVitol plc employed the controversial tax avoidance scheme known as \'Employee Benefit Trusts\'. (EBTs) Such schemes allowed employees to avoid paying income tax and companies to avoid national insurance contributions. Vitol used the scheme \'for more than a decade\'.\nTax evasion and avoidance costs the UK Exchequer tens of billions of pounds a year. EBTs were banned in 2011. Vitol then entered negotiations with HMRC over claims that it still owed millions of pounds in unpaid taxes.\nWhat did Ian Taylor know about the company\'s tax avoidance scheme? Even if it met legal requirements, does he consider tax avoidance to be morally just? Is Better Together aware of these claims against the company of its major donor? Vitol state their tax arrangements are legal.\n4) Ian Taylor has been accused of improper political donations to the Conservative Party.\nAccording to today\'s Sunday Herald, Ian Taylor has donated \xc2\xa3550,000 to the Conservative Party since 2006. He was one of the 70 millionaires who paid the \xc2\xa350,000 privilege to join David Cameron\'s Leaders Group. Leaders Group membership led, in many cases, to a private dinner with the Prime Minister, which Taylor attended in Downing Street on November 2nd 2011. This was part of the ""cash for access scandal"".'",b'Rosina Cargill',2017-04-09 18:17:05,0

Yes, the present Tory government has a austerity programme, and yes it is trying to cut social welfare spending. But whilst it may be making some quite serious cuts, in reality it is just tinkering at the edges. Yes, we need more doctors, yes we need more nurses and careers, but there is a limit on how much you can tax people before they get up and leave. It is also a fact that the less you tax people, the more they have to spend, the more they buy in the shops, the more jobs created, the more tax you collect. The Tory government have followed that policy by increasing borrowing in order to maintain services without increasing taxes.\nNo we will consider an independent Scotland. We already have  \xc2\xa315bn difference between what we raise in taxes and what we spend on social welfare, we could borrow the \xc2\xa315bn, but that would be another \xc2\xa315bn next year, and again the year after. So maybe we borrow a bit, and raise taxes to make up the difference. But, ad we have jus said, raising taxes cuts spending. So we we will also have to cut welfare spending, and I don't mean tinkering at the edges. Do you really want to see the pension age raised to 90 so that most people die before they can claim it, Do you want to se people having to pay \xc2\xa310 to see their doctor. Do you want to see anyone who has at least three limbs to be expected to work.\nThese sound draconian, but no one has yet shown a possible alternative.

It has nothing whatsoever to do with Salmond or the snp. Don\'t let political ignorance ruin this opportunity.\n\nDo you know...

Not one vote cast in SCOTLAND has ever mattered! Because of the Westminster numbers, whatever government England votes for, the UK gets. So we have no democracy here!!! 4 decades of tory rule that we voted against is proof enough, and our defiance was punished by the closure of all the mines; closure of all the steelworks; closure of all the shipyards losing thousands of jobs. The term used by Thatcher when these industries needed some assistance was ""let the markets decide"". Funny how when the greedy banks collapsed everywhere they were bailed out to the tune of over a trillion pounds of our money... Not a mention of ""let the markets decide"".\n\nFACTS:\nFact: Scotland has an oil boom waiting to happen on the West Coast, but Michael Hesaltine signed a cessation of any form of oil exploration in the entire area in the 80\'s to make way for nuclear submarines which Scotland doesn\'t want!\n\nFact: Scotland has shown its revulsion time and time again to nuclear weapons but they place them here against our countries wishes. A recent contingency report was carried out about the feasibility of relocating them in Portsmouth. The report stated that it was unfeasible because the detrimental risk to the area of an incident was too high. (Ok for the Clyde though)\n\nFact: Scotland, with only 1 Tory MP, was forced to take the shocking attack on the poor & disabled called The Bedroom Tax, even though Holyrood voted to utterly reject this awful tax on the poor. Westminster gave us it anyway!\n\nFact: We are led to believe that the oil in our waters is finished and its a dying industry. Yet 13.5 billion has been invested by oil companies in the last 2 years alone!\n\nFact: The Clair Oil Field is about to open it\'s 3rd phase, and on its own has over 650 million barrels which will be extracted over 20+ years with production reaching a hundred thousand barrels a day!\n\nFact: Scotland gives more to Westminster than it gets back. Do you really think they\'d be so keen to keep us if we were being subsidised like they\'d have us believe?\n\nFact: Westminster has amassed over \xc2\xa31.3 trillion debt and still growing at nearly \xc2\xa36000 a second. Thats another \xc2\xa3516 million today alone which YOU will have to pay for.\n\nFact: Of the 178 countries that have gained their own independence across this planet, not one single one of them has ever asked to reverse this independence'",b'Alex James Mackintosh',2017-04-07 16:05:47,1

The actual ""facts"" of the economy in Scotland after Indy do not exist. That works both ways. Nationalist predictions of an economic miracle in Scotland are not based on one fact. Not one. Reject the GERS figures if you like. However, SNP used them for its ""White Paper"". Please produce actual figures from the Nationalists on the economic picture of Indy Scotland. \n\nHowever, in 2014, Swinney predicted increased debt with plans for massive borrowing- Nationalist predictions, no-one else\'s. Then, an Indy Scotland would struggle to pay pensions. The oil industry is in decline. There would be huge infrastructure costs- the benefits system is an example. The ""benefits on demand"" of ""fairness"", would cost billions. Then, there is SNP incompetence with tax. Do you think that this is a sound ""economic model"" for Indy? Nope.\n\nThen, there would be EU membership at  \xc2\xa31 billion per year. Then, there would be no ""UK cash""- Indy DOES mean full financial autonomy. There\'s a lot more, but you get the idea.\n\nThe ""normal"" running costs- SNHS etc. would increase. Then, taxes would have to increase. All this time, the economy is stagnating with low growth. You cannot increase the deficit and debt, or you will go bust. If you think that there would be a ""windfall"" of cash and resources after Indy, you are naive.\n\nIf you think that ""Westminster"" is thin on the economic ""facts"" of Indy, please provide Nationalist ""facts"". There aren\'t any, of course. It\'s all mere speculation. On economics, SNP, in denial, fails every time, The answer is always ""let\'s get Indy first and the problems can be solved later"". So, Indy is the priority and the economic success of Scotland certainly isn\'t. \n\nOf course, as SNP walks away, job done, Scotland is left as an economic basket case- outwith the UK and outwith the EU.

I feel that much of the dissatisfaction which has led to the Brexit vote is because of the effects of economic liberalism which was supposed to spread wealth, but didn\'t. Monbiot pointed out recently that when economic liberalism caused the 1929 crash, Keynesianism was waiting in the wings, and had already been thought about. It improved matters until the 1970s, when people became dissatisfied with ""stagflation"" and other problems, so neoliberalism came along. It, too, had already been thought about, and was ready to take over. Now we have individuals and corporations using the comparative lack of globalisation of politics to squirrel away money, leaving the less well-off to pay for the running of society. After it triumphed with the right, the left bought into it, so no one has thought about what might replace it. On the face of it, it would seem that the globalisation of company and tax rules would tackle the hiding of money, so a resurgent nationalism would seem the last thing that might help - it will exacerbate the very economic problems that have led people to a nationalist position.

It has nothing whatsoever to do with Salmond or the snp. Don\'t let political ignorance ruin this opportunity.\n\nDo you know... This is the UK\'s legacy of success in our history of being better-together:\n\nThe UK has the 3rd lowest pensions in the 34 OECD countries of the world\n\nThe UK has the single most expensive childcare in the European Union\n\nThe UK has the second lowest-paid economy in the entire developed world\n\nThe UK has the 3rd longest working hours in the EU\n\nThe UK has the lowest number of holidays in the EU\n\nThe UK has the 8th highest gender inequality pay gap out of the EU\'s 28 countries\n\nThe UK has the highest likelihood of poverty in disablement in the EU\n\nThe UK has the highest rail prices in Europe\n\nThe UK has the second highest housing cost in Europe\n\nThe UK has the highest fuel poverty rates in Europe.\n\nThe UK is the 4th highest country of wealth inequality in the entire planet!\n\nSurely these awful figures should not be possible when you read the Scottish statistics above...\n\nFinally, did you know that in all of the UK elections for Westminster ever!... Not one vote cast in SCOTLAND has ever mattered! Because of the Westminster numbers, whatever government England votes for, the UK gets. So we have no democracy here!!! 4 decades of tory rule that we voted against is proof enough, and our defiance was punished by the closure of all the mines; closure of all the steelworks; closure of all the shipyards losing thousands of jobs. The term used by Thatcher when these industries needed some assistance was ""let the markets decide"". Funny how when the greedy banks collapsed everywhere they were bailed out to the tune of over a trillion pounds of our money... Not a mention of ""let the markets decide"".\n\nFACTS:\nFact: Scotland has an oil boom waiting to happen on the West Coast, but Michael Hesaltine signed a cessation of any form of oil exploration in the entire area in the 80\'s to make way for nuclear submarines which Scotland doesn\'t want!\n\nFact: Scotland has shown its revulsion time and time again to nuclear weapons but they place them here against our countries wishes. A recent contingency report was carried out about the feasibility of relocating them in Portsmouth. The report stated that it was unfeasible because the detrimental risk to the area of an incident was too high. (Ok for the Clyde though)\n\nFact: Scotland, with only 1 Tory MP, was forced to take the shocking attack on the poor & disabled called The Bedroom Tax, even though Holyrood voted to utterly reject this awful tax on the poor. Westminster gave us it anyway!\n\nFact: We are led to believe that the oil in our waters is finished and its a dying industry. Yet 13.5 billion has been invested by oil companies in the last 2 years alone!\n\nFact: The Clair Oil Field is about to open it\'s 3rd phase, and on its own has over 650 million barrels which will be extracted over 20+ years with production reaching a hundred thousand barrels a day!\n\nFact: Scotland gives more to Westminster than it gets back. Do you really think they\'d be so keen to keep us if we were being subsidised like they\'d have us believe?\n\nFact: Westminster has amassed over \xc2\xa31.3 trillion debt and still growing at nearly \xc2\xa36000 a second. Thats another \xc2\xa3516 million today alone which YOU will have to pay for.\n\nFact: Of the 178 countries that have gained their own independence across this planet, not one single one of them has ever asked to reverse this independence'",b'Alex James Mackintosh',2017-04-07 14:12:57,0

If you've already got three children NOW and get ill or lose your job in the future, why is that fair?\n\nThe bottom line is that this law is inhumane.  It punishes kids who didn't ask to be born.  It is horrendous for women who have a third child through rape, which could be their partner's child.  It's not as simple and black and white as people make out.  At the end of the day it's the kids that will suffer.  It's all very well telling people to be responsible but circumstances change, accidents happen.

Again, this is a devolved power to local councils. The SNP have pledged \xc2\xa34million of business rate relief funding for Aberdeen if they gain control of the local council next month. For the third one, that's a fair point. The delays have been hard on farmers due to the new IT system in place. However, it should be pointed out that the Scottish Government under the SNP have protected LFASS payments to farmers, while this has been completely scrapped south of the border. For the fourth one, it hardly needs to be said. Scotland's economy will continue to shrink over the next few years. Scotlands economy is far more heavily dependent on the EU than the wider UK economy, which is why we must do everything we can to protect Scotlands access to the single market and boost business and consumer confidence. For the last one, all bills have agreed deadlines and having looked on the parliamentary website for these bills, no deadlines have yet to be broken by the SNP. Everything is on schedule.""",b'Fraser Stewart',2017-04-06 16:46:20,7

In my life I have seen the Anglican Church practically destroyed by the sinful squeeze of feminist and gay crusaders. In the UK many historic Anglican Churches simply reverted back to being Roman Catholic, to avoid the ongoing smothering deadly fog that people with a leftist feninist agenda promoted in the Church. In Canada the Anglican Church fell apart. In the 1980\'s it is stated that ther were 60 declared homosexuals in priest collars attending the Toronto Synod, making their particular ""rights""the focus of the road forward, and abandoning tried and true values and traditions. Clergy and congregations alike scattered, from one end to the country to another. Former Bishop Wilkinson of Vancouver Island hopped off the Anglican wagon and became a Roman Catholic Priest, now a Bishop in fact and much admired at home and in Rome. As a female and a former priest, you must see the parallels to some extent, in theprofile of the Nicola Sturgeon support base, and those who destroyed the Anglican Church. Call my remarks rot if you will, but with THE GREATEST OF RESPECT you of all people simply must admit that the comparisons are valid, the sinful threats are the same, and that ther eis no logic whatsoever in pitching for a second indyref vote with the full intention of giving up immigration, resource taxation, border control, migration of jobs, Scottish fishing rights, and the rights to make serious and impacting laws all over to Germany and France and the little back room group who control the EU. As a priest/minister/clergy person, you surly must have the best interests of the souls in your care at heart. However your very interest in politics, The SNP and this entire political mess in the UK, is nor perhaps something you should be giving advice on. My realtives...many of them in fact, fought on the air, on the seas and on the ground in a horrific second world war to rid the UK of the bonds of slavery and oppression foisted upon them by satanic forces in Europe. Now Nicola Sturgeon ridicules and badgers and insults Prime Minister May almost daily, to promote her poison, poorly-thought-out leftist agenda.Her immigration agenda is such that Scottish culture and life could be all but wiped out in less than a decade, if her plan were to succeed. She and her english husband have hijacked the SNP, catered to the radical side, the leftists and the gay/lesbian radicals, and she will continue swing fruther left until she is stopped. She will NEVER win an agenda. This time the big money will make a concentrated effort to derail her. Scots will pay the price by losing that final decent chance to attain individual free nationhood. That freedom will never come in the EU. The EU is going to implode. With RESPECT your time might well be better spent praying for Scots and Scotland, nor standing alongside the radicals who would destroy her, as they did the once mighty Anglican Church. May God Bless Scotland, now and in the future.'",b'Stephen Esteban Davie',2017-04-06 17:14:36,0

I don't know if she is ignorant, or if she is deliberately trying to mislead gullible people but the powers promised to Scotland were delivered. We got power over the Crown Estates a few days ago and assumed responsibility for income tax this very day. Anyway, the 'promises' that the seps keep banging on about were irrelevant, they did not affect the result of our referendum. Irene's post is pointless, she's unhappy about something and is just letting off steam. Every time I read a similar post I am more convinced that Scotland will never be 'independent'.\n\nAs for Fiona's tuppence worth, no one has any need whatsoever to justify Scotland remaining in the U.K. We get a fairly good deal out of the UK and it was up to the separatists to prove that 'independence' would have benefited Scotland, but they couldn't.

The way you have put it accross is rational and polite, not like many others on both sides of the argument. I am getting at the people who seem blatantly trying to stir up I\'ll feeling and thoughtless slurs and name calling. That is unfair and negative harming the rights of both sides to promote and stick to the facts. I don\'t believe it\'s up to the Independence believers to defend themselves against the mindset of the people who post unconstructive trouble making posts on SNP posts. They are writing on a site that is open to all, but is just letting people interested what their Government are doing as is the job it should be conveying. There is nothing to answer to. Times change people\'s views change.  People who get married intend to for life. But if one partner is abused or betrayed; that partner has the right to see the marriage contract is broken and so leave. Even after maybe re said their vows during their time together. The abused partner still has the right to change their mind. There was a surge in support for the SNP after the 2014 vote. Yes the ""NO"" vote won then and that would have been that. But attitudes changed, promises changed, the way people saw after the vote what went on that felt wrong. People have felt a need that life is not better together. Scotland has been ignored and yes given some promises. You as a winner and wanting to stay within the UK part that wants the union. The Westminster government is part of that. That is where your union depends on to continue with the Tory party. You don\'t have to justify that as what that party is doing to the poorest and vulnerable is what enrages me. I don\'t want to win your vote or anyone else like you. That\'s your life\'s decision as it\'s right for you. If you want to change again it\'s not up to me or my intent to change it. I am not a nationalist or an activist. I\'m me a carer throughout my life to different people in need. I\'m reacting to what I see as injustice and rejection of people\'s needs. That\'s my priority. I happen to like what I see the SNP trying to do in general. If any other party was doing similar, I would listen to them. No party is perfect or do I agree totally. Please don\'t pre judge me or my comment that was geared towards people who were just saying abusive things. It is better if you feel like viewing another Parties page to either read and leave alone or politely comment constructivly. I hope you now know where I\'m coming from and your vote doesn\'t interest me. The Union is your choice and you\'ve told me. Enjoy it. All the best to you and the future.

I believe that the Tory party might be manipulating the situation, forcing Scotland to go for Independance now as they see it's a time where all the attention is on Brexit. I mean we have already forgotten about the Tories Austerity. Well in the media anyway. So Brexit is working well for them and its because of them introducing the public vote for it, maybe in the same scenario, the focus and excuse that Brexit is all they can work on at this time. This the Tories can use to discredit Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP, for being seen as self centered and not putting their full attention into running Scotland. The same then can be said about Theresa May and the Tories who said they can only concentrate on Brexit. It's double standards and doesn't get the Media highlighting this point. I can't totally agree with you therefore on if the SNP Government stopped working on Independance, it would make any difference to the way they are focusing on the country. I think they should be able to do both. I can't predict or see anything that shows they are not. Quite the contrary. Nicola Sturgeon is in America drumming up business and the Voice of Scotland for our country. I'm not saying the SNP is perfect or the last resort but from what I have experienced and read, Scotland has been predicted by independent financial advisers from around the world that we can thrive better on our own. Also Nicola Sturgeon is seen to be a Very Good leader. We can only take this chance as the alternative if people would only believe the facts of what negativity and harmful policies to our society and using the vulnerable to pay for the state the UK is in and which they denie. So yes another Independance vote in roughly 18 months time might be doomed to fail. I see that. But chances are it wont be in a truly democratic open minded way. The future if Scotland doesn't try I can only see as things being much, much worse than they are now under a Tory Government.

One is perfectly legal- the other isn\'t. \n\nAs to ""taking money from the poor"", free prescriptions for all is a very good example of that- the poor subsidise the wealthy. Be assured- education is the way to resolve poverty, in an economy of growth. Currently, SNP is  destroying education- under-skilling young Scots.  Growth is stagnating.

I disagree with that belief system, but that\'s their choice. That brainwashing is being perpetuated by comments such as yours. Women have described abortions on TV, talked about them, even televised them, and it is not like having a heart transplant, which is what you make it sound like. In fact, by perpetuaing that myth, that somehow women might avoid it because they think it is \'scary\' or something, you are perpetuating the anti-abortion culture which want to oppress women\'s rights, and that male-dominated narrative, that there is something bad, difficult, or disgusting about it, is part of the cause of some women taking their pregnancies into late term, when obviously, the decision is a more difficult one. Perpetuating the myth that it is so hard, or disgusting, is also making the system that provides it more incoherent, because they also have to deal with the prejudices from families, society, and the women themselves, who may have been indoctrinated with your kind of thinking. Therefore, the whole act of abortion becomes something people don\'t even talk about, and the whole thing becomes more incoherent and stigmatized.\n\nThese women do talk about it:\n\n""""It was less physically traumatic than I\'d assumed it would be.

As a man, I ask myself if I would have an abortion (eg. because I am starting in college or something), and it is not a totally clear answer. In the case of college I think I would because having a baby at that time, could affect the rest of your life, if it affects your education, and you need all the education you can get to give the child the best you can. Later in life, I think maybe I would have the baby, even if the man was not around. But a rapist's baby? I don't think so. Immediate trip to the clinic for me, if I was a woman who got raped. But then the whole stigma and complexities about rape comes in, but, again., that has more to do with stigma, and should not be part of our era. So I see how that social pressure could lead a woman to delay abortion perhaps. Perhaps that stigma by society needs to change.\n\nThe whole stigma society has made around the ancient practice of abortion is also causing women to doubt wether they could do it. It would be interesting to see in which country the least stigma about abortion exists in society, and if women are more open and easy with it than they are in UK or USA. The lack of people talking about it, and the stigma that causes, is also contributing to the unpleasantness about something women have done for thousands of years.""",b'Tommy Barlow',2017-04-07 16:35:01,0

Now we see the real-life impact of her mismanagement.\n\n""More than ever, Scotland needs a First Minister in charge who gets back to her desk, ends her obsession with a second referendum and focuses on her day job.""\n\nSturgeonGETTY\nThe SNP attempted to blame Brexit for the poor performance\nThe new data revealed Scotland\'s economic output dropped by 0.2 per cent in the three months to December - the first decline since the third quarter of 2015.\n\nThe UK economy grew by 0.7 per cent over the same period. \n\nOver the 12 months to December, Scotland\'s economy grew by only 0.4 per cent - lagging behind the rate of 1.8 per cent across the whole UK.\n\nBut compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, Scottish output was flat (0.0 per cent change).\n\nIf the next tranche of GDP figures for Scotland due to be released in July also show output shrinking, the country will officially be in recession.\n\nFinance Secretary Derek Mackay claimed the statistics reflect the ""economic reality of the Brexit vote"".\n\nRELATED VIDEOS\nNicola Sturgeon: I don\'t believe Scotland should join Eurozone\nSturgeon: The will of the Scottish people MUST be respected\nNicola Sturgeon: 2016 was a tumultuous year in politics\nHe said: ""We have already seen significantly lower consumer confidence in Scotland since the vote last summer.\n\n""Now we see that feeding through into our growth figures and all of this is before the UK actually leaves the EU.""\n\nBut Professor Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute at the University of Strathclyde, said: ""At a time when the UK economy grew at 1.8 per cent over the same period, this is a serious cause for concern.\n\n""With any Brexit uncertainty affecting the UK as well, it\'s hard to argue that Scotland\'s relatively weaker performance can be explained by the outcome of the EU referendum.""\n\nEconomist John McLaren forecast income tax revenues will be between \xc2\xa3369 million and \xc2\xa31.6 billion lower over the next five years if Scotland\'s economy continues to lag behind the rest of the UK at rates of 0.5 per cent or 1 per cent, respectively.\n\nThis stands at \xc2\xa33.1 billion for all taxes in the event of independence, but his analysis raises the prospect of further hikes or spending cuts \n\nScotland\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (R) reacts as she leaves the chamber following a vote on the second day of the \'Scotland\'s Choice\' debate on a motion to seek the authority to hold an indpendence referendum at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh AFP/GETTY IMAGES\n1 of 11\nScotland\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (R) reacts as she leaves the chamber following a vote on the second day of the \'Scotland\'s Choice\' debate on a motion to seek the authority to hold an indpendence referendum at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh\nScotland\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (R) reacts as she leaves the chamber following a vote on the second day of the \'Scotland\'s Choice\' debate on a motion to seek the authority to hold an indpendence referendum at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh\nPro-independence supporters outside Holyrood react to the vote being passed for a second referendum\nJulie from The Indy Girls runs to hug Lorna Taylor as they celebrate outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh after MSPs backed Nicola Sturgeon\'s call for the powers to hold a second independence referendum\nJulie from The Indy Girls hugs Lorna Taylor as they celebrate outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh after MSPs backed Nicola Sturgeon\'s call for the powers to hold a second independence referendum\nJulie from The Indy Girls hugs Lorna Taylor  as they celebrate outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh after MSPs backed Nicola Sturgeon\'s call for the powers to hold a second independence referendum\nIndependence supporters celebrate outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh after MSPs backed Nicola Sturgeon\'s call for the powers to hold a second independence referendum\nPro-independence supporters outside Holyrood react to the vote being passed for a second referendum\nScottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said: ""While the SNP continue to obsess over independence our economy has been left behind.\n\n""These figures show the risk that Scotland will be left behind under the SNP. Unless the SNP get a grip of the economy then our public services will be hit too.""\n\nScotland Office minister Lord Andrew Dunlop highlighted an extra \xc2\xa31.2 billion of funding for SNP ministers as a result of spending commitments for other parts of the UK and challenged them to use Holyrood\'s new powers to boost growth.\n\nHe added: ""Of course, the simplest way to provide more certainty for people and businesses across Scotland would be to take a second independence referendum off the table."" \n\nLiz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce called for an ""urgent change"" in SNP policy.\n\nHitting out at its stance on income tax and business rates she warned: ""It is time for the Scottish Government to abandon this high tax agenda before it is too late as these policies risk driving investment out of Scotland.""'",b'Melvyn Crossley',2017-04-05 15:12:16,12
