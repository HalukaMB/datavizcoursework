  <h2>How users interact with facebook pages of political parties</h2>
  <div class="textbox">Social media has become increasingly important in politics.
    Posting something badly phrased can cause a shitstorm, create a digital outrage and have analogue implications as far as <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sweden-politician-roland-pettersson-kalmar-anyone-shoot-donald-trump-us-president-facebook-social-a7543796.html">stepping down as a MP.</a>
    But platforms can also give a party completly new possibilities to campaign and stay in touch with voters.
   In this article I want to look at how parties in the UK differ in terms of what kind of reactions they cause on Facebook.
  </div>
  <div class="textbox">What would happen, if we did not give parties seats based on the constituencies they win but based on the number of comments
    they receive per post. Or the number of reactions such as likes, sad, happy, angry and love emojis? Well, the House of Commons would be a pretty different parliament. </div>
    <form action="" id=radiobuttonA>
        <input type="radio" name="radiochoice" value="Seat" checked="checked"> Seat
        <input type="radio" name="radiochoice" value="Comment"> Comment
        <input type="radio" name="radiochoice" value="Reaction"> Reaction
        <input type="radio" name="radiochoice" value="AngryReac"> Angry
    </form>
    <div id="UKhalfcircle" class="chartcircle"></div>
    <div class="textbox">If the "Facebook parliament" would be based on the number of comments, the Conservatives would probably still be in power - but likely in a coalition
    together with UKIP. The heavy Leave-campaigning party gets almost 21 percent of all comments of UK parties represented in the parliament. If you look at reactions in general, the race is much tighter with
    all parties getting roughly the same amount of likes or other reactions per post. However, reactions can be very different. In fact, if you look at who gets the most angry reactions per post, the picture changes.
    The conservatives of Theresa May do not ignite a lot of rage. But Labour, Greens and UKIP do, with especially the latter two exceeding by far their actual importance in parliament.  </div>
    <div class="textbox">To see in detail how each of the parties performed, navigate through the graphics below. </div>
    <div id=UKbarsContainer>
        <div class="barselement">

    <div class="textbox">Facebook reactions as a measure for rants could be problematic. For one, a lot of people are still using them sparsely.
      Even in the case of the three parties that caused the most angry reactions on Facebook, the angry reaction only makes up about a tenth of all the reactions or even less.
      (Green party: 11%, Labour: 9%, UKIP: 5%) Also there is the chance that people rather express their anger by commenting.
      Hence, I did an analysis of the comments on parties' Facebook pages and analyse for 5,000 comments the ratio of spelling mistakes and exclamation marks per words.
   </div>
   <div class="textbox">The dot in the middle of the box shows the average ratio, the box around it is the 95% confidence interval.
     Interestingly enough, statistical analysis shows that each party has significantly less spelling mistakes than the average of the parties on its right of the political spectrum.
     So commentators on Facebook pages of the right-wing parties tend to make more spelling mistakes which could be a hint for anger. However, this correlation was not present for exclamation marks.</div>

                <input type="radio" name="radiochoiceB" value="Mistake" checked="checked"> Spelling Errors
                <input type="radio" name="radiochoiceB" value="Excl"> Exclamation marks
            </form>

    <script src="UKhalfcircle_new.js"></script>
    <script src="UKbarchart.js"></script>
    <script src="UKboxplot.js"></script>
    <div class="textbox">All in all, it can be said that there is a clear difference in the way how users comment and react on the Facebook posts of parties.
      In the case of spelling mistakes, it can even be concluded that there is a tendency that commentators on left/liberal parties' pages make less mistakes than on parties that are more on the right.
      However, it has to be noted that these results do not allow to draw any conclusions on whether voters of these parties tend to be more angry, more outraged or simply worse in terms of spelling words.
